    "artistName": "Edward Okuń",
    "description": "A woman with a warm, golden complexion sits in a comfortable armchair, her long neck cradling a gentle, enigmatic smile. Her eyes, with eyelids slightly lowered, seem to hold secrets and stories within their soft brown depths. The contours of her face are softly defined, with high cheekbones and a delicate nose ringed by fine lines. A delicate lace collar frames her neck, adding a touch of elegance to the overall scene. The background is a warm, muted tone, possibly a soft beige or pale yellow, subtly illuminated from an unknown source."

    "description": "Vibrant, dreamlike depiction of dolls and toys, suspended in mid-air, surrounded by intricate lace-like patterns and swirling clouds of pastel hues, amidst a subtle glow of soft candlelight; delicate porcelain skin, wispy hair, and intricately stitched clothing on the dolls' faces, with a focus on gentle, ethereal expressions and subtle gestures as if frozen in time."

    "description": "A portrait of an elderly man with a prominent nose, thick eyebrows, and a wispy beard, set against a warm golden background with subtle hints of blue.

    "paintingLabel": "Polish Hamlet. Portrait of Aleksander Wielopolski",
    "artistName": "Jacek Malczewski",
    "description": "A hauntingly beautiful portrait of a man in his 50s, dressed in formal attire, sits solemnly against a dark background. His eyes are sunken and his gaze is directed downward, as if lost in thought. The lighting is dim, with only a faint glow emanating from an unknown source, casting long shadows across his pale complexion. His face is gaunt, with deep lines etched into his forehead and around his mouth, conveying a sense of introspection and melancholy. A crimson cloak, tattered and worn, drapes loosely over his shoulders, adding to the overall air of sorrow and despair."
