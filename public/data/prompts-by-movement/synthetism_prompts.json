    "description": "A dreamlike landscape featuring a house situated at the bottom of a lush, verdant park, surrounded by towering trees with thick trunks and gnarled branches. The house's walls are weathered to a warm golden brown, with a steeply pitched roof and chimney puffing out a gentle plume of smoke. A winding path leads up to the house, disappearing into the foliage. The surrounding environment is alive with lush greenery, including ferns, wildflowers, and vines crawling up the trees' trunks."
