    "description": "A tender scene depicting a newly born infant lying in a ornate wooden crib, surrounded by soft fabrics and delicate lace. The baby's fragile form is swaddled in a white cloth, with tiny hands curled up towards its face. The crib itself is adorned with intricate carvings and gilded details, set against a warm beige or cream-colored background. A few wisps of fine hair are visible on the baby's forehead, and its small features seem to be gazing upwards with an air of serenity."
