    "description": "A quiet urban street scene featuring a row of shops on one side, with their facades worn and weathered, and a few people scattered about outside. The atmosphere is subdued, with warm sunlight casting long shadows across the sidewalk. A lone figure stands in the doorway of one shop, dressed in a coat and hat, looking out onto the street. In the background, a cityscape stretches upwards, with towering buildings and smoke rising from various sources."

    "description": "A late-night diner scene, bathed in a warm glow, features a sleek black and white fa√ßade, its rounded windows and awning-style sign reflecting neon lights from within. The interior is dimly lit, with a few patrons sitting at the counter, their faces obscured by shadows. A solitary figure stands at the door, gazing out into the city night, while others sit alone at tables, lost in thought."
