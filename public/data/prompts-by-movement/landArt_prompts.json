    "description": "A large-scale abstract sculpture features a series of interconnected steel beams, covered in layers of rust and corrosion, stretching across the canvas like a spider's web. The beams' surfaces are rough-hewn and textured, with jagged edges and sharp ridges that give the piece a sense of tension and instability. A thin veil of dark blue pigment hangs suspended above the structure, casting a somber shadow over the entire composition."

    "description": "A large, darkened room filled with thousands of ovoid shapes, each one covered in a thick layer of grayish-brown wax and twigs, suspended from the ceiling by thin wires and wooden dowels, some leaning precariously against others, amidst a backdrop of rough-hewn wooden boards and dimly lit by flickering fluorescent lights."
