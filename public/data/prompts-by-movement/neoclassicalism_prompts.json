    "description": "A classical nude sculpture depicting three female figures standing together, their faces serene and introspective. The central figure is slightly turned away from the viewer, while the other two women face forward, their gazes directed at an unseen point in the distance. Their bodies are slender and elegant, with subtle curves and contours that evoke a sense of sensuality and femininity. The marble-like texture is smooth to the touch, with a soft, luminous glow that seems to emanate from within. The composition is balanced and harmonious, with each figure forming a triangle that creates a sense of stability and equilibrium."
