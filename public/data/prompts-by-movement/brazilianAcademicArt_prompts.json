    "description": "A dramatic scene set against a dark blue sky, illuminated by a glowing crescent moon, depicts a young woman standing proudly, her back to a crumbling column, as she gazes out at a distant sea. Her flowing hair and clothing are buffeted by a fierce wind, while her right hand grasps a sword, its hilt adorned with a small flag bearing the colors of the national emblem. In the background, a fleet of ships sails towards the horizon, their sails billowing in the wind."
