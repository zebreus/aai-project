    "description": "A serene landscape featuring a lone shepherd standing at the edge of a peaceful meadow, surrounded by a flock of sheep grazing quietly. The sky above is a soft blue with only a few wispy clouds drifting lazily across it. In the distance, a gentle hill rises up, covered in lush greenery and dotted with clusters of wildflowers. The shepherd wears a simple tunic and hat, and carries a staff in one hand while keeping a watchful eye over his flock."
