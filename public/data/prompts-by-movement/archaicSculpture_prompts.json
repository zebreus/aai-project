    "description": "A young male figure, depicted in three-quarter view, stands relaxed against a subtle, gradient background. His skin has a warm, golden undertone, and his facial features are defined by gentle curves and soft lines. The eyes, almond-shaped and slightly upturned, seem to gaze thoughtfully into the distance. A subtle smile plays on the lips, hinting at a quiet introspection. The subject's hair is depicted in loose, tousled curls, framing his face with a sense of carefree abandon."
