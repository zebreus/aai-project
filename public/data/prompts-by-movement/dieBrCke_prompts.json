    "description": "A female figure stands tall, her body bent slightly to one side as if leaning against an invisible wall. Her skin is a warm beige color, with subtle shading and texture suggesting a gentle firmness. A wide-brimmed hat sits atop her head, its curved shape echoing the contours of her face. The brim is a deep brown that almost matches the rich tones of her hair, which falls in loose waves down her back. Her eyes are cast downward, lost in thought as she gazes at something just beyond her own reflection."
