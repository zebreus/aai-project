    "description": "A regal figure, King Candaules, stands naked in front of a marble bath, his back to a large mirror. He is surrounded by luxurious drapery and opulent furnishings, while a servant, Gyges, crouches behind him, preparing to uncover the king's hidden secret. The atmosphere is one of tension and anticipation, with soft golden light illuminating the scene."
