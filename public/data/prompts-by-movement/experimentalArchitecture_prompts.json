    "description": "A futuristic cityscape with crumbling concrete skyscrapers, twisted metal beams, and overgrown vegetation. A massive, decaying statue stands tall in the center, its once-grandiose features now shrouded in vines and moss. The surrounding landscape is littered with rusting machinery, abandoned vehicles, and discarded debris. In the background, a hazy cityscape looms, with towering spires and pyramids of steel and glass reaching towards the darkened sky."
