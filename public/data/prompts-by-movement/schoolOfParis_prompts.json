    "paintingLabel": "Jeanne HÃ©buterne in yellow sweater",
    "artistName": "Amedeo Modigliani",
    "description": "Portrait of a young woman wearing a yellow sweater with a loose, relaxed fit, her arms crossed over her chest and her hands hidden beneath the fabric. Her face is elongated, with prominent cheekbones and a small mouth, framed by thick eyebrows and large, expressive eyes that seem to gaze off into the distance. The subject's skin has a warm, golden undertone, and her dark hair falls in loose waves around her face. The background of the painting is a soft, muted blue, with subtle brushstrokes suggesting texture and depth. The overall mood is one of quiet contemplation, with the subject exuding a sense of calm introspection."
