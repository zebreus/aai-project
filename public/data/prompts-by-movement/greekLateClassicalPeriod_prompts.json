    "description": "A classical Greek goddess stands nude, her back to the viewer, as she gazes longingly into a reflective surface, likely a pool of water or a mirror. Her skin is smooth and luminous, with gentle curves and subtle folds. A drapery of gauzy fabric billows behind her, its soft folds echoing the contours of her body. The overall mood is one of serene contemplation, as if the goddess has stepped out of a mythological tale to pause in quiet reflection."
