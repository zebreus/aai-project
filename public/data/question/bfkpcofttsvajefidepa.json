  "description": "Ernst Ludwig Kirchner painted this work, Bathers at Moritzburg, in 1926 during his stay in Moritzburg, Germany. This large oil on canvas features five nude bathers enjoying a day at the beach. The bright colors and expressive brushstrokes capture the energy and joy of the scene. The figures are arranged in an asymmetrical composition, with some standing and others sitting or reclining. The background is filled with vibrant blues and greens that contrast with the warm tones of the figures. Kirchner's use of light and shadow creates a sense of depth and movement throughout the painting. His bold use of color and dynamic brushwork make this work a striking example of Expressionist art."
