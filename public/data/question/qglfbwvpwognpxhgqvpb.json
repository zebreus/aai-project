  "description": "In the center of the painting there is a young woman who seems to be nude. She sits on the ground and has her right leg stretched out while her left leg is bent. Her upper body is slightly tilted towards the viewer. A cat can be seen sitting on the left of the woman. It seems that the cat is resting its head on the woman's right thigh. The woman seems to have closed her eyes. It looks like she is thinking about something. Her face shows an expression of deep thought. The background is almost completely black except for a few white lines. These lines are mostly located on the right side of the painting."
