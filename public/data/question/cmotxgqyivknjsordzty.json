  "description": "Aspiration and Literature is a bronze sculpture by James Earle Fraser that was created in 1950 in the United States of America. The sculpture depicts a winged horse, which symbolizes the power of literature to inspire and uplift the human spirit. The horse is shown rearing up on its hind legs, with its wings outstretched as if it were about to take flight. This represents the idea that literature can transport us to other worlds and help us to see the world in new ways. The sculpture is made of bronze, which gives it a timeless and classic look that is fitting for a work of art that celebrates the enduring power of literature."
