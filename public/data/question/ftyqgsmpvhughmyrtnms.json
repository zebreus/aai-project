  "description": "Portrait of the artist's daughter is an oil painting on canvas by Joan Brull Vinyoles from 1900, Spain. It measures 58cm high and 377cm wide. The painting depicts a girl holding a doll and wearing a dress that covers most of her body. She stands against a background of yellow curtains and flowers. The colors used are muted browns and yellows which create a warm feeling in the viewer. The composition is well balanced with the girl positioned centrally in the frame surrounded by large areas of negative space. This creates a sense of calmness and serenity. Overall, this is a beautiful piece of art that conveys the innocence and joyfulness of childhood."
