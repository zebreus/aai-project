  description:
    "In this painting, several children are depicted sunbathing on the beach, with their bodies facing away from the viewer. One of the boys is looking directly at the viewer, while another is looking at his friend. They all seem to be enjoying the warm summer sun and the cool water of the Mediterranean Sea. The painting is done in the Impressionist style, which is characterized by its loose brushstrokes and bright colors.",
