  "description": "The painting depicts a harbor at Lormont with ships docked on either side of the water. There are several buildings visible in the background, including a church and some houses. The sky is mostly cloudy, but there are some patches of blue showing through. In the foreground, there are two men sitting on a bench looking out over the harbor."
