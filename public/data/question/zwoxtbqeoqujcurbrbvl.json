  "description": "Marzella is a young woman who was a popular model for Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. She is painted with great detail. Her face has a strong outline and her hair is flowing down her back. Her eyes are staring directly at the viewer, which gives the painting a somewhat eerie feeling. Her body is painted in a realistic way, with a lot of detail. She is sitting on a bed, with her legs crossed. Her arms are resting on her knees. She is wearing a dress that is very low-cut, and her breasts are almost completely exposed. This gives the painting a very sexual feeling. The colors used in the painting are very bright and intense. The background is a dark red, which makes the painting even more dramatic."
