  "description": "The painting is a neoclassical work depicting Danaë and the Shower of Gold painted by Adolf Ulrik Wertmüller in 1787. It is painted in oil on canvas and measures 150 cm x 190 cm. The painting is a depiction of the mythological story of Danaë and Zeus, where Zeus impregnates Danaë in the form of a golden shower. The painting shows Danaë lying on a bed in a bedroom, with a pearl in her hand and a quiver at her side. She is showered with golden coins and jewels from the sky, which are collected in a vespaio by two putti. The painting is a beautiful example of neoclassical art, with its use of classical motifs and its focus on the human form."
