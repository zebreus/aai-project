  "description": "This is a scene from the alleyways of Tangier. The sun shines brightly in the sky, illuminating the rooftops and walls of the buildings that line the street. People go about their daily lives, some walking down the street while others sit or stand outside their homes. There is a sense of peace and tranquility in the air, as people go about their business without any rush or stress. The colors are vibrant and cheerful, reflecting the happiness of the people who live here."
