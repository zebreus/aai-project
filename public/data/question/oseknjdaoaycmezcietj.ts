    "The Magpie is a painting by French impressionist Claude Monet, from 1868. It depicts a snow-covered field, with a lone magpie perched on a post near a wooden gate. Behind it is a wooden house with a thatched roof and two chimneys, probably farm buildings. Monet has applied his paint thickly, in the manner of Gustave Courbet, creating a sense of winter weather.
