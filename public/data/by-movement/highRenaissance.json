It depicts Mary embracing the child Christ, while the young John the Baptist devoutly watches.\\nPainted during his Roman period, this Madonna does not have the strict geometrical form and linear style of his earlier Florentine treatments of the same subject. Instead, the warmer colors seem to suggest the influence of Titian and Raphael's rival Sebastiano del Piombo.\\nIngres greatly admired Raphael and paid tribute to him by including this painting in many of his works, such as in the background of Henri IV playing with his children and Raphael and La Fornarina, on the table in front of the subject in his Portrait of monsieur Rivière, and worked into the carpet in Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne. Johann Zoffany also included this painting along with many others in his 1770s painting of the Tribuna of the Uffizi.Because of the painting's roundness, it became the subject of a legend in which a peasant girl saves a hermit from a pack of wolves in the branches of an oak, and the hermit prophesies that she will become immortalized for her good deed. Years later, the girl had two children, and the tree was made into wine barrels. Raphael happened upon the trio and used a barrel bottom to paint them. This scenario was the subject of an 1839 lithograph by August Hopfgarten and a painting by Johann Michael Wittmer.In 1858, Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote that the painting was 'the most beautiful picture in the world' after having seen it via 'a hundred engravings and copies'.",

It depicts a nude young woman, traditionally identified with the goddess Venus, reclining on a couch or bed in the sumptuous surroundings of a Renaissance palace. It is now in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence.\\nThe figure's pose is based on the Dresden Venus, traditionally attributed to Giorgione but which Titian at least completed. In this depiction, Titian has domesticated Venus by moving her to an indoor setting, engaging her with the viewer, and making her sensuality explicit. Devoid as it is of any classical or allegorical trappings – Venus displays none of the attributes of the goddess she is supposed to represent – the painting is sensual and  unapologetically erotic.\\nInterpretations of the painting fall into two groups.  Both agree that the painting has a powerful erotic charge, but beyond that it is seen either as a portrait of a courtesan, perhaps Zaffetta, or as a painting celebrating the marriage of its first owner (who according to some may not have commissioned it).  This disagreement forms part of a wider debate on the meaning of the mainly Venetian tradition of the reclining female nude, which Titian had created, or helped to create, some 25 years before with the Dresden Venus of around 1510-11.  For Charles Hope, 'It has yet to be shown that the most famous example of this genre, Titian's Venus of Urbino, is anything other than a representation of a beautiful nude woman on a bed, devoid of classical or even allegorical content.'  Even the indefatigable finder of allegories drawing on Renaissance Neoplatonism, Edgar Wind, had to admit that in this case 'an undisguised hedonism had at last dispelled the Platonic metaphors'.",

It was purchased from Christie's by the 4th Marquess of Bath in 1878 and had been at Longleat until the theft.As with most of the Teniers miniatures for the Archduke, it is unclear whether the engraving was made after the miniature or after this painting, but in any case the current literature points to this painting as the original source for both works. It can be seen hanging to the right of the doorway in one of Teniers' reproductions of the Archduke's gallery.",

Martin Luther had recently challenged papal authority, listing among other grievances, Leo X's method of selling indulgences to fund work on St Peter's.\\nThe pommel on top of the Pope's chair evokes the symbolic abacus balls of the Medici family, while the illuminated Bible open on the table has been identified as the Hamilton Bible.The cardinals are usually identified as Giulio di Giuliano de' Medici and Luigi de' Rossi.",

It is considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, and has been described as 'the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world.' The Mona Lisa is also one of the most valuable paintings in the world. It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known insurance valuation in history at US$100 million in 1962 (equivalent to $852,139,072.85 as of 2019).The painting is thought by many to be a portrait of  the Italian noblewoman Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, and is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. It had been believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. Recent academic work suggests that it would not have been started before 1513. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic itself, on permanent display at the Louvre Museum in Paris since 1797.The subject's expression, which is frequently described as enigmatic, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism are novel qualities that have contributed to the continuing fascination and study of the work.",

Its central scene depicted four men riding raging war horses engaged in a battle for possession of a standard, at the Battle of Anghiari in 1440.\\nMany preparatory studies by Leonardo still exist. The composition of the central section is best known through a drawing by Peter Paul Rubens in the Louvre, Paris. This work, dating from 1603 and known as The Battle of the Standard, was based on an engraving of 1553 by Lorenzo Zacchia, which was taken from the painting itself or possibly derived from a cartoon by Leonardo. Rubens succeeded in portraying the fury, the intense emotions and the sense of power that were presumably present in the original painting. Similarities have been noted between this Battle of Anghiari and the Hippopotamus Hunt painted by Rubens in 1616.\\nIn March 2012, it was announced that a team led by Maurizio Seracini had found evidence that the painting still exists on a hidden inner wall behind a cavity, underneath a section of Vasari's fresco in the chamber.\\nThe search was discontinued in September 2012, without any further progress having been made, due to conflict among the involved parties.",

Most of these are 'Giorgionesque' genre or tronie subjects where the subjects are anonymous, though the group includes Titian's The Tribute Money, with Christ as the main figure, which in terms of style is similar to this painting, and his Lucretia and her Husband, also in Vienna, where at least the woman's identity is clear, if not that of the man.Alternative attributions are to Giorgione (in the past) and Palma Vecchio.",

After the master's death in 1520, Gianfrancesco Penni, Giulio Romano and Raffaellino del Colle from Raphael's workshop worked together to finish the commission to decorate with frescoes the rooms that are now known as the Stanze di Raffaello, in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican.\\nThe Vision of the Cross is located in the Sala di Costantino ('Hall of Constantine'). In the painting, emperor Constantine I is seen just before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge on October 28, 312. According to legend, a cross appeared to Constantine in the sky, after which as seen in the fresco and following Eusebius of Caesarea Vita Constantini, he adopted the Greek motto 'Εν τούτῳ νίκα', i.e. 'By this, conquer', a motto that has been rendered in Latin as 'In hoc signo vinces', i.e. 'In this sign you shall conquer'.\\nThis Mannerist painting is a crowded and confused melee and melange of images, including a dragon, a dwarf, two popes, and various symbols. Proportions among the soldiers appear confused, with some dwarfed by more distant figures.",

It was painted as a pendant to the Portrait of Laura Dianti of the same year (Laura Dianti was Alfonso I d'Este's lover) and is now known through copies, one of which is by Rubens and another of which is held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Others are held in the collections of the countess of Vogüe Commarin at Dijon and the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen - the latter is the oldest but only shows the head and shoulders.\\nThe painting showed its subject with his right hand on the muzzle of a cannon and his left hand on the hilt of his sword, underlining his martial prowess during a tense time in his relations with the papacy. It was an influence on Dosso Dossi's later portrait of the duke in a similar pose, leaning on a cannon.\\nThe original was seen by Vasari and admired by Michelangelo on the latter's visit to Ferrara in 1529. It was later given to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who kept it for a time in Bologna before taking it to Spain. It is mentioned in the 1666 and 1686 inventories of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid, but disappeared during the 18th century.",

It was painted in 1514, as part of a commission Raphael had received from the Sienese banker Agostino Chigi to decorate the interior of Santa Maria della Pace in Rome.The painting shows four sibyls - Cumaean, Persian, Phrygian and Tiburtine, accompanied by attendant angels. Art historian Michael Hirst notes there is a 'striking' parallel between the figures of the Sybils and the practice sketches of Michelangelo.",

Though it is believed that Raphael did make the designs for the composition, the fresco was probably painted by Gianfrancesco Penni. The painting was part of Raphael's commission to decorate the rooms that are now known as the Stanze di Raffaello, in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. It is located in the room that was named after The Fire in the Borgo, the Stanza dell'incendio del Borgo. The painting shows how Charlemagne was crowned Imperator Romanorum by Pope Leo III (pontiff from 795 to 816) on Christmas Evening, 800. It is quite likely that the fresco refers to the Concordat of Bologna, negotiated between the Holy See and the kingdom of France in 1515, since Leo III is in fact a portrait of Leo X and Charlemagne a portrait of Francis I.",

    "abstract": "Justice or Judith is a dry fresco by Titian, dating to around 1508 and now in the Galleria Giorgio Franchetti alla Ca' d'Oro, Venice. Its secondary title refers to Judith from the Apochrypha.\\nIt was originally on the facade of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, rebuilt in 1508 after the previous building was destroyed by fire. 1508 documents attest to a dispute over payment to Giorgione - these documents also show that the external frescoes had not yet been completed at that point. They were painted by Castelfranco and his young pupil Titian. The frescoes were to represent symbols of Venice's autonomy, since they were painted at a time of conflict between the Republic and Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. \\nVasari saw the frescoes less than a century after their completion - he did not understand their meaning but praised their proportions and 'most lively' colouring, which made them seem 'alive and not imitations'. Justice was originally over the southern doorway, leading to a narrow alleyway. Dolce records an episode in 1557, when it was mistaken for a work by Giorgione. Damaged by the humid and brackish climate of the lagoon, the frescoes were taken off the walls and moved indoors into the Galleria Giorgio Franchetti alla Ca' d'Oro and the Galleria dell'Accademia.",

Michelangelo probably completed this panel in the summer of 1512, the last year of the Sistine ceiling project. It is one of five smaller scenes that alternate with four larger scenes that run along the center of the Sistine ceiling. The Separation of Light from Darkness is based on verses 3–5 from the first chapter of the Book of Genesis:\\n\\n3And God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light.\\n4God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness.\\n5God called the light 'day,' and the darkness he called 'night.' And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.Although in terms of the Genesis chronology it is the first of nine central panels along the Sistine ceiling, the Separation of Light from Darkness was the last of the nine panels painted by Michelangelo. Michelangelo painted the Sistine ceiling in two stages. Between May 1508 and the summer of 1511, he completed the 'entrance half' of the Sistine chapel and ended this stage by painting the Creation of Eve and the scenes flanking this central panel. After an idle period of about 6 months, he painted the 'altar half,' starting with the Creation of Adam, between the winter of 1511 and October 1512.",

It was painted between 1512 and 1514  as part of Raphael's commission to decorate with frescoes the rooms that are now known as the Raphael Rooms, in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. It is located in the Stanza di Eliodoro, which is named after The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple.\\nThe Mass at Bolsena depicts an Eucharistic miracle that is said to have taken place in 1263 at the church of Santa Cristina in Bolsena. A Bohemian priest who doubted the doctrine of transubstantiation, was celebrating mass at Bolsena, when the bread of the eucharist began to bleed. The blood that spouted from the host and fell onto the tablecloth in the shape of a cross and he was reconverted. The following year, in 1264, Pope Urban IV instituted the Feast of Corpus Christi to celebrate this miraculous event. The blood stained Corporal of Bolsena is still venerated as a major relic in the Orvieto Cathedral.\\nPresent in this painting is a self-portrait of the artist, Raphael, as one of the Swiss Guard in the lower right of the fresco, facing out with bound-up hair.  This is one of several instances in which Raphael has placed himself in his paintings.  Also shown in the work is Pope Julius II (1443–1513), kneeling at the right, and his daughter Felice della Rovere, shown on the left at the bottom of the steps, in profile, in dark clothes. The four cardinals to the right have also been identified as Leonardo Grosso della Rovere, Raffaello Riario, Tommaso Riario and Agostino Spinola, relatives of Julius.",

Michelangelo's imagining bursts with movement, as Isaiah's cloak swirls around him. The colors in the portrayal – especially after the restoration – strike us as cool and luminous. The figure holds a distinctive blue book to his side, perhaps a depiction of the biblical Book of Isaiah.\\nThis painting has been held in particularly high regard by critics. Vasari said of it: 'Anyone who studies this figure, copied so faithfully from nature, the true mother of the art of painting, will find a beautifully composed work capable of teaching in full measure all the precepts to be followed by a good painter'. If compared to Raphael's imagining of the same figure, Michelangelo's portrayal seems far more fluid and less muscular, as well as brighter in color.\\n\\n",

It is signed and dated in 1514, though most of the work on it is thought to have been carried out in 1513. \\nA series of documents dating to 1511-1513 document progress on the work. From them Shearman theorises that most of the painting took place in 1513. Andrea wished to leave after completing the frescoes of the life of Philip Benizi de Damiani on the opposite side of the atrium. However, the friar in charge of the frescoes, the sacristan fra Mariano dal Canto delle Macine, insisted that Andrea paint two further lunettes with scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary. Andrea agreed, only in return for an increased payment for the final frescoes.\\nLike the other frescoes in the chiostro, the Nativity was detached from the wall, restored and replaced on the wall during the 1960s, which limited the damage to it from the Florence flood of 1966. The Gabinetto dei Disegni e delle Stampe of the Uffizi includes a late 16th century drawing of the fresco, attributed to Maso da San Friano (n. 6466).",

The contrasts are striking between the red of his hat, whiteness of his sleeve and his face. Meticulous brushstrokes give the audience a three-dimensional character,  revealing Rapahel’s interest in sculpture during those years. \\nThe painting was acquired by Carlos IV of Spain (1748–1819) in Rome, while the latter was still a prince. \\nThe picture was attributed to Antonio Moro, due to its technique, considered unusual in Raphael.",

The depiction of religious passion in the painting is still reminiscent of Pietro Perugino.

Although only recently attributed to Raphael, it is ranked among the best portraits by his hand.\\nThe neatness of the large areas of colour which emerge in lighter tones from the background, and the analytical treatment of the details of the woman's clothing are characteristic of Raphael. The dispersive effect of this attention to detail is fully compensated by the tones of colour - used here in a fairly limited range - which unify the composition as a whole.\\nNicoletta Baldini describes the hands in this portrait as 'vibratile,' a distinction from Michelangelo or Da Vinci.X-ray analysis has shown the presence of an early Raphael drawing under the painting, of a female, young face with soft features, with later modifications.",

    "abstract": "The Three Ages of Man is a painting by Titian, dated between 1512 and 1514, and now displayed at the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh. The 90 cm high by 151 cm wide Renaissance art work was most likely influenced by Giorgione’s themes and motifs of landscapes and nude figures—Titian was known to have completed some of Giorgione’s unfinished works after Giorgione died at age 33 of the plague in 1510. The painting represents the artist’s conception of the life cycle. Childhood and manhood are synonymous with earthly love and death approaching old age are drawn realistically. Titian’s widely chosen topic in art history, ages of man, mixed with his own allegorical interpretation make The Three Ages of Man is one of Titian’s most famous works.",

It was painted between 1511 and 1513 as part of Raphael's commission to decorate with frescoes the rooms that are now known as the Stanze di Raffaello, in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. It is located in the room that takes its name from it, the Stanza di Eliodoro.\\nThe Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple illustrates the biblical episode from 2 Maccabees (3:21-28). Heliodorus is ordered by Seleucus IV Philopator, the king of Syria, to seize the treasure preserved in the Temple in Jerusalem. Answering the prayers of the high priest Onias, God sends a horseman assisted by two youths to drive Heliodorus out.\\nAt the left, Raphael's patron, Julius II witnesses the scene from his litter. The money had been reserved for widows and orphans and a priest had seen and prayed and God sent down a horseman to drive him from the temple. The composition is divided into two halves, in the centre is the priest praying and the priest looks much like Julius II. On the right is the horseman fighting Heliodorus. The menorah by the priest in the centre shows that this is set BC and it is authentic. On the left are widows and orphans grouped together and Julius II is being carried on a throne, witnessing this event. The message of the fresco is “don’t steal from the church”. The architecture begs comparison with the school of Athens, although the Domes in “The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple” are much richer and are gilded and highly decorated.\\nThe work contains a self-portrait by Raphael, near the far left.",

It perhaps depicts a figure representing the bride dressed in white, sitting beside Cupid and accompanied by the goddess Venus.The title of the painting is first recorded in 1693, when it was listed in an inventory as Amor Divino e Amor Profano (Divine love and Profane love), and may not represent the original concept at all.Although 'much ink has been spilt by art historians attempting to decipher the iconography of the painting', and some measure of consensus has been achieved, basic aspects of the intended meaning of the painting, including the identity of the central figures, remain disputed.",

He was a cultured man who liked the arts. \\nThe graceful, almost effeminate position of the subject along with the heavy contrast between light and shadow are atypical of Raphael's work, particularly of his portraits of men, demonstrating the artist's experimentation with different styles and forms in his later Roman period.  The influence of the works of Leonardo, which Raphael studied astutely during this period of his career, is strikingly evident in this particular piece.\\nThe painting was a property of Altoviti’s descendants until 1808, when it was sold to Ludwig I of Bavaria. It remained at the Alte Pinakothek until 1936, when, after many debates about its attribution, the painting was lured out of Nazi Germany by 'canny English dealers'. Acquired by Samuel Henry Kress, the portrait subsequently became property of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C..\\nA bronze bust of Altoviti by Benvenuto Cellini is exhibited in Boston at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.",

    "abstract": "Portrait of Young Woman with Unicorn is a painting by Raphael, which art historians date to 1505 or 1506. It is in the Galleria Borghese in Rome. The painting was originally oil on panel, and was transferred to canvas during conservation work in 1934. It was in the course of this work that overpainting was removed, revealing the unicorn, and removing the wheel, cloak, and palm frond that had been added by an unknown painter during the mid-17th century.\\n\\nThe composition of the picture--placing the figure in a loggia opening out onto a landscape, the three-quarter length format-- was apparently inspired by the Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo between 1503 and 1506. Christof Thoenes observes: 'However unabashedly Raphael adopts the pose, compositional framework and spatial organization of the Leonardo portrait...the cool watchfulness in the young woman's gaze is very different' from the 'enigmatic ambiguity' of Mona Lisa.The work was of uncertain attribution until recent times. In the 1760 inventory of the Gallery, the subject of the painting was identified as Saint Catherine of Alexandria and attributed to Perugino. A restoration of the painting in 1934–36 confirmed art historian Roberto Longhi's attribution of the work to Raphael, and the removal of heavy repainting revealed the unicorn, traditionally a symbol of chastity in medieval romance, in place of a Saint Catherine wheel. Restoration work on the painting in 1959 revealed through radiography the image of a small dog, a symbol of conjugal fidelity, under the unicorn. This alteration is believed to have been made by Raphael; it is not known why the alteration was made.",

The Farnese family later acquired and renamed the villa, smaller than the more ostentatious palazzo at the other side of the Tiber. The fresco is a mythological scene of a series embellishing the open gallery of the building, a series never completed which was inspired to the 'Stanze per la giostra' of the poet Angelo Poliziano. In Greek mythology, the beautiful Nereid Galatea had fallen in love with the peasant shepherd Acis. Her consort, one-eyed giant Polyphemus, after chancing upon the two lovers together, lobbed an enormous pillar and killed Acis.\\nRaphael did not paint any of the main events of the story. He chose the scene of the nymph's apotheosis (Stanze, I, 118–119). Galatea appears surrounded by other sea creatures whose forms are somewhat inspired by Michelangelo, whereas the bright colors and decoration are supposed to be inspired by ancient Roman painting. At the left, a Triton (partly man, partly fish) abducts a sea nymph; behind them, another Triton uses a shell as a trumpet. Galatea rides a shell-chariot drawn by two dolphins.\\nWhile some have seen in the model for Galatea the image of the courtesan, Imperia, Agostino Chigi's lover and Raphael's near-contemporary, Giorgio Vasari wrote that Raphael did not mean for Galatea to resemble any one human person, but to represent ideal beauty. When asked where he had found a model of such beauty, Raphael reportedly said that he had used 'a certain idea' he had formed in his mind.\\nIn a letter to Baldassare Castiglione, Raphael dictated via Pietro Aretino, that 'to paint a beauty, I should have to see a number of beauties, provided Your Lordship were with me to choose the best. But in the absence of good judges and beautiful forms, I use an idea that comes to my mind.'",

    "abstract": "A Man with a Quilted Sleeve is a painting of about 1510 by the Venetian painter Titian in the National Gallery, London, measuring 81.2 by 66.3 centimetres (32.0 in × 26.1 in).  Though the quality of the painting has always been praised, there has been much discussion as to the identity of the sitter.  It was long thought to be a portrait of Ariosto, then a self-portrait, but in 2017 is called Portrait of Gerolamo (?) Barbarigo by the gallery, having also been called merely Portrait of a Man, the title used here, The Man with the Blue Sleeve, and no doubt other variants.\\nPlacing a parapet, a low wood or stone sill or ledge, between the subject and the viewer is a common feature of early Renaissance Italian portraits, as a useful way of solving 'the principal compositional problem' of portraits at less than full-length, how 'to justify the cutting of the figure'. By having the large sleeve project slightly beyond the parapet, Titian 'subverts' the usual barrier effect, bringing the picture space into 'our space' as viewers.  The turning pose, with the head slightly atilt and an eyebrow appearing raised, exactly halfway across the composition, adds life and drama.  The 'broad spiral motion in depth of the head and arm' suggests that Titian had some awareness of contemporary developments in painting in Florence.  The sleeve is brilliantly painted, and the 'merging of the shadowed portions of the figure with the grey atmospheric background ... is one of the most innovative and influential aspects of the painting'.The painting comes from a crucial period in the development of the Italian Renaissance portrait, which was then being led by Venice.  According to John Steer, Titian retains the 'mood of generalized inner mystery' that Giorgione had brought to his portraits (which may not represent individuals who commissioned the painting) but shows the personality and 'physical assurance' of his sitter with new force and realism.  To some extent the 'ardent gaze' of this and other figures is adopted from paintings of religious subjects.The pose was borrowed in two self-portraits by Rembrandt, who saw the painting (or a copy) in Amsterdam.  Soon after it apparently moved to England via France.  It entered the National Gallery in 1904 as NG1944, and in 2017 was on display in Room 2.\\n\\n",

Completed ca. 1506, the painting hangs in the  Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest.The image is ostensibly a portrait of Venetian Cardinal Pietro Bembo, Raphael's long-time friend. Raphael did make a black chalk drawing of Bembo during Bembo's visit to Urbino in 1506. The picture hung in Bembo's home for years before it disappeared.\\nThe lack of resemblance of this picture to its namesake, particularly in the nose, has led to other subjects being proposed, including Agnolo Doni, whom Raphael  painted around the same time. In a 2004 biography of Bembo, Carol Kidwell states that the subject 'appears a happy courtier, not a man set on making his mark in the world, and he wears a red beret while Venetian noblemen wore black.'",

It is located in the Stanza di Eliodoro, which is named after The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple. The painting shows how Saint Peter was liberated from Herod's prison by an angel, as described in Acts 12.  It is technically an overdoor.\\nThe fresco shows three scenes in symmetrical balance formed by the feigned architecture and stairs. In the centre the angel wakes Peter, and on the right guides him past the sleeping guards.  On the left side one guard has apparently noticed the light generated by the angel and wakes a comrade, pointing up to the miraculously illumined cell.  This adds drama to the serene exit of Peter at the right.",

It is now in the Royal Collection, and in 2018 was in the King's Closet at Windsor Castle.  Since at least 1983 it has been called Boy with a Pipe ('The Shepherd') by the Royal Collection; previous titles the collection recognise include Shepherd with a pipe, and The Shepherd.A boy or young man now in a loose white shirt looks away from the viewer out of the picture space, apparently 'lost in thought'.  He holds a woodwind instrument, as though he has just been playing it.  X-ray radiography reveals that the figure 'originally wore a more formal style of white shirt with continuous gathers under a slate-blue doublet'.  This has implications for the question of whether the painting was ever intended as a portrait of an individual, or, as is generally thought more likely, is an idealized and generalized image of a type.  This type of painting can be traced back to Leonardo da Vinci but was taken up by several Venetian artists in the early 16th century.Though now not generally thought to be painted by Giorgione, the composition and subject are certainly very much in his style, and this may be a copy of a lost original by him. It is very similar in composition and mood to the Boy with an Arrow, (1506?) in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, which is 'a rare example of a painting still universally attributed to Giorgione'.  This is partly because it was mentioned by Marcantonio Michiel in 1531, along with a lost 'shepherd who holds fruit in his hand'.",

This has implications for the question of whether the painting was ever intended as a portrait of an individual, or, as is generally thought more likely, is an idealized and generalized image of a type.  This type of painting can be traced back to Leonardo da Vinci but was taken up by several Venetian artists in the early 16th century.Though now not generally thought to be painted by Giorgione, the composition and subject are certainly very much in his style, and this may be a copy of a lost original by him. It is very similar in composition and mood to the Boy with an Arrow, (1506?) in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, which is 'a rare example of a painting still universally attributed to Giorgione'.  This is partly because it was mentioned by Marcantonio Michiel in 1531, along with a lost 'shepherd who holds fruit in his hand'.",

    "description": "painting by Raphael",
    "abstract": "Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione is a c. 1514–1515 oil painting attributed to the Italian High Renaissance painter Raphael. Considered one of the great portraits of the Renaissance, it has an enduring influence. It depicts Raphael's friend, the diplomat and humanist Baldassare Castiglione, who is considered a quintessential example of the High Renaissance gentleman.\\nThe portrait was produced as a result of Raphael's friendship with Castiglione, whose ascent in courtly circles paralleled that of the artist. They were close friends by 1504, when Castiglione made his second visit to Urbino, as Raphael was gaining recognition as an artist in the humanist circle of the city's ducal court. Raphael was commissioned by Guidobaldo da Montefeltro in 1505 to paint a picture for Henry VII; Castiglione traveled to England to present the finished painting to the king. It is possible that Castiglione later served as a 'scholarly advisor' for Raphael's The School of Athens, and that the depiction of Zoroaster in that fresco may be a portrait of the courtier.Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione may have had a practical and intimate purpose. Castiglione left his family behind when he went to Rome, and he wrote a poem in which he imagined his wife and son consoling themselves with the picture during his absence.The composition is pyramidal. It's one of only two Raphael's paintings on canvas (it was considered before as originally painted on a wood panel, and later transferred to canvas). Copies produced in the 17th century show Castiglione's hands in full, suggesting that the picture was subsequently cut by several inches at the bottom (at a later date researchers determined it has not been cut). Castiglione is seated against an earth-toned background and wears a dark doublet with a trim of squirrel fur and black ribbon; on his head is a turban topped by a notched beret. The attire indicates that this was painted during the winter, likely that of 1514–1515, when Castiglione was in Rome by appointment of Guidobaldo da Montefeltro to Pope Leo X. The lightest areas are the subject's face seen nearly head-on, a billow of white shirt front at his chest, and his folded hands, which are mostly cropped at the bottom edge of the canvas. Castiglione is seen as vulnerable, possessing a humane sensitivity characteristic of Raphael's later portraits. The soft contours of his clothing and rounded beard express the subtlety of the subject's personality. In his The Book of the Courtier Castiglione argued on behalf of the cultivation of fine manners and dress. He popularized the term sprezzatura, which translates roughly to 'nonchalant mastery', an ideal of effortless grace befitting a man of culture. The concept eventually found its way into English literature, in the plays of Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare.The picture's elegance of execution is consistent with the attitude of the subject. Art historian Lawrence Gowing noted the counter-intuitive handling of gray velvet (actually a fur) as contrary to an academic modeling of form, with the broad surfaces banked in rich darkness and the fabric shining most brightly as it turns away from the light. For Gowing, 'The picture has the subtlety of baroque observation but the stillness and noble contour of classic painting at its peak.' The portrait's composition and atmospheric quality suggest an homage to the Mona Lisa, which Raphael would have seen in Rome. Yet the Castiglione portrait transcends questions of influence; art historian James Beck wrote that 'The Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione stands as a final solution for single male portraiture within the Renaissance style....'Notwithstanding shifts in the critical appraisal of Raphael's work, the painting has enjoyed consistent admiration from other artists. Titian was strongly influenced by this portrait, and may have first viewed it in Castiglione's home in Mantua. The Venetian master's Portrait of a Man (Tommaso Mosti?) is generally seen as owing a strong compositional debt to Raphael's painting, and also reflects Castiglione's influential advice regarding the restrained elegance of attire recommended for courtiers. In 1639 Rembrandt drew a sketch of the painting while it was being auctioned in Amsterdam, and subsequently referenced the composition in several self-portraits. A copy of the painting, now in the Courtauld Institute of Art, was painted by Peter Paul Rubens. Both Rembrandt's and Rubens's versions display Baroque flourish, quite different from the original painting's sober restraint. In the 19th century Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres chose a frame for his Portrait of Monsieur Bertin much like that which adorned Raphael's painting, perhaps indicating Ingres's ambitions, while also underscoring the paintings' similarities of coloration and extraordinary illusionism. At the turn of the 20th century Henri Matisse copied the painting, and Paul Cézanne exclaimed of Raphael's portrait: 'How well rounded the forehead is, with all the distinct planes. How well balanced the patches in the unity of the whole....'Now in the Louvre, the painting was acquired by Louis XIV in 1661 from the heirs of Cardinal Mazarin.",

It is in the National Gallery in London.  It probably formed a pair with the Three Graces panel, also 17 cm square, now in the Château de Chantilly museum.\\nThere are a number of theories as to what the panel is intended to represent.  Some art historians think the sleeping knight  represents the Roman general Scipio Aemilianus (185–129 BC) who dreamed that he had to choose between Virtue (behind whom is a steep and rocky path) and Pleasure (in looser robes). However, the two feminine figures are not presented as contestants. They may represent the ideal attributes of the knight: the book, sword and flower which they hold suggest the ideals of scholar, soldier and lover which a knight should combine.\\nThe most likely source for the allegory depicted is from a passage in the Punica, an epic poem recounting the Second Punic War by the Latin poet Silius Italicus.The panel was moved to England by William Young Ottley in 1800.\\nRaphael used an extensive palette of paints to depict this colourful scene. Pigments such as lead-tin yellow, ultramarine, verdigris and ochres have been identified.",

    "abstract": "The Madonna of the Candelabra is a Madonna painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael, dating to about 1513 and is in the collection of the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore. \\nPainted during his Roman period, this tondo Madonna of the Virgin and Child employs a rare motif of flanking candelabra that was derived from representations of ancient Roman emperors. Through this reference to the rulers of antiquity, Raphael alludes to Christ's and Mary's roles as the king and queen of Heaven.   Raphael was famed for his graceful style. which combined the study of classical sculpture and nature. The chiaroscuro effects (modeling in light and shade) and gentle coloring give the figures a soft, delicate appearance. The painting relies heavily on the participation of Raphael's workshop, and the two angels certainly were done by his assistants. This was the first Madonna painted by Raphael to enter a North American collection. It was purchased by Henry Walters in 1901.The central portion of the painting was issued as the traditional holiday first class Christmas stamp for 2011 by the United States Postal Service.  The stamp was released on October 13, 2011 in New York, New York.",

It was praised by Vasari, and is arguably the artist's best-known work.\\nThe Virgin is standing on a pedestal which includes harpies sculpted in relief, from which the painting takes its name.  At least Vasari, and presumably his Florentine contemporaries, thought they were harpies; some modern art historians think that locusts are represented, in a reference to the Book of Revelation; either way they represent forces of evil being trampled on by the Virgin.It is a sacra conversazione showing the Virgin and Child flanked by putti angels and two saints (Saint Bonaventure or Francis and John the Evangelist).  Compared to the stillness of earlier paintings of similar groups, here the 'dynamism of the High Renaissance was inimical to the static quality of 15th-century art', so that 'a composition of fundamentally classical purity is animated by a nervous energy in the figures to produce an unsettling impression of variety.'It was completed in 1517 for the church of the convent and hospital of San Francesco dei Macci in Florence; this was run by the Poor Clares and is long closed, but the church building survives.  The figures have a Leonardo-like aura, with a pyramid shaped composition.   The harpies, figures from pagan mythology (or locusts), here represent temptation and sin, which the Virgin has conquered and stands upon. The Christ Child is shown as unusually old, and has an athletic contrapposto pose.  He looks down to the putti, and all three have a 'mischiefness' that contrasts with the serious, abstracted, air of the adults.The main character in the Kürk Mantolu Madonna ('Madonna With A Fur Coat'), a novel written by Turkish writer Sabahattin Ali, is a depiction of the Virgin Mary in Madonna of the Harpies.",

It is the largest altarpiece in the city, with the figures well over life-size, necessitated by the large church, with a considerable distance between the altar and the congregation.\\nIt marked a new direction in Titian's style, that reflected his awareness of the developments in High Renaissance painting further south, in Florence and Rome,  by artists including Raphael and Michelangelo.  The agitated figures of the Apostles marked a break with the usual meditative stillness of saints in Venetian painting, in the tradition of Giovanni Bellini and others.It was perhaps originally rather shocking for the Venetian public, but soon recognised as a masterpiece that confirmed Titian's position as the leading artist in Venice, and one of the most important in all Italy, a rival to Michelangelo and Raphael.",

    "abstract": "Lucretia and her Husband Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus or Tarquin and Lucretia is an oil painting attributed to Titian, dated to around 1515 and now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The attribution to this artist is traditional but uncertain - the brightened palette suggests it could instead be by Palma Vecchio. However, others identify the painting as part of Titian's series of half-length female figures from 1514 to 1515, which also includes the Flora at the Uffizi, the Woman with a Mirror at the Louvre, the Violante and the Young woman in a black dress in Vienna, Vanity in Munich and the Salome at the Galleria Doria Pamphilj.  There is an early copy in the Royal Collection.Lucretia poised with a dagger, about to commit suicide, was becoming a very common subject in art. However, the addition of a male figure just behind her is all but unique. The Kunsthistorisches Museum now calls this figure Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, Lucretia's husband, but the Royal Collection identifies him as her rapist, Sextus Tarquinius (known as Tarquin), as do most sources. Her husband was present at her death, according to most of the differing Roman accounts of the story, and Tarquin was not. If the figure is intended to be Tarquin, the setting must be the night before, with Lucretia perhaps making her plan.\\nThe painting depicts Lucretia about to commit suicide to preserve her honour after disclosing her rape by Sextus Tarquinius the previous night, making her the model of Roman female virtus. Her face looks up to the divine illumination coming from above, giving her the strength to commit the act. As in other treatments of the subject, there are sensual elements, such as Lucretia's falling robe and almost-bared breast. The robe's green is particularly bright, witnessing to the high quality of pigments available in Venice.\\nThe painting can be seen as one of a number of Venetian paintings of the 1510s showing two or three half-length figures with heads close together, often with their expressions and interactions enigmatic. Most of these are 'Giorgionesque' genre or tronie subjects where the subjects are anonymous.  \\nThe painting in Vienna, or the other version still in the Royal Collection, may be the painting mentioned by Ridolfi in 1648 as being in the gallery of Charles I of England, whose Italian paintings mainly came from his purchase of the Gonzaga collection in Mantua. The Vienna version might have passed to the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria.  \\nTitian's better known late depiction of Lucretia's rape by Tarquin was completed over 50 years later, in 1571 (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge).",

The London work is first recorded in inventories of the Galleria Borghese in 1693 and 1750. In 1800 it was acquired by William Young Ottley, from whom it passed to the Earl of Normanton's collection at Somerley House. \\nSeveral copies of the painting survive - the best are in Apsley House, the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna and the Museo Davia Bargellini.

Commissioned for a church in Bologna, the painting now hangs there in the Pinacoteca Nazionale, or National Painting Gallery.  According to Vasari the musical instruments strewn about Cecilia's feet were not painted by Raphael, but by his student, Giovanni da Udine.English Romantic poet Percy Shelley described the painting as follows:\\n\\nThe central figure, St. Cecilia, seems rapt in such inspiration as produced her image in the painter's mind; her deep, dark, eloquent eyes lifted up; her chestnut hair flung back from her forehead — she holds an organ in her hands — her countenance, as it were, calmed by the depth of its passion and rapture, and penetrated throughout with the warm and radiant light of life. She is listening to the music of heaven, and, as I imagine, has just ceased to sing, for the four figures that surround her evidently point, by their attitudes, towards her; particularly St. John, who, with a tender yet impassioned gesture, bends his countenance towards her, languid with the depth of emotion. At her feet lie various instruments of music, broken and unstrung.",

It and the rest of the Farnese collection were later moved to Naples and the work was exhibited for a few years in the Palazzo Reale before moving to its present home in the National Museum of Capodimonte. Two early copies remain in the Galleria Nazionale and Palazzo Comunale in Parma. \\nIts attribution to Parmigianino is almost undisputed, though its dating is more debated - some scholars place it in his period in Rome (1524-1527) and others to his time in Bologna (1527-1530), whilst Freedberg argues it belonged to a second stay in Parma (1530-1539). Its technique and style probably date it to his time in Bologna - the mineral colours are typical of work in fresco and the work is in glue tempera or gouache. Vasari records Parmigianino painting two works in gouache in Bologna 'for Master Luca di Leuti'.\\nFour preparatory drawings for the work survive (one each) in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle (RCIN 990346), the Galleria nazionale di Parma (inv. 510/5), the British Museum (1905,1110.18) and the Ashmolean Museum (inv. 446).

Dating from 1521–1534 the sculpture is a piece of the altar decoration of the Sagrestia Nuova in the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence.The work, according to Michelangelo's letters and other documents, was one of the first works begun for the decoration of the Sagrestia Vecchia (Old Sacristy), as early as 1521. In 1526 it was still incomplete and in 1534, when Michelangelo moved to Rome, it was left in the current unfinished state and moved to the current location by Niccolò Tribolo.\\nThe Medici Madonna depicts a scene of the infant Jesus Christ sitting in the lap of the Virgin Mary and facing away from the viewer. Christ is attempting to nurse from the Virgin Mother, who by every indication appears to be denying her breast to her child.  The Virgin Mary is positioned sitting with her right arm behind her and she is gripping the edge of her seat and then her left hand rests on Christ’s arm but is in no way securing him to her or offering an embrace. Another indication of the Virgin Mother denying the infant Christ of her breast is shown through the girdled chiton garment she is wearing that completely conceals her. There has been speculation that a Roman copy of the 5th century statue of Penelope influences the pose in this sculpture. Several preparatory drawings (at the British Museum and the Albertina) show a less compact composition, in which the Madonna's legs were parallel to each other. The composition is somewhat similar to the Madonna of the Stairs, with the Virgin sitting on nearly cubic block and breastfeeding the Child. The latter is turning his body towards his mother, hiding the face from the seer.\\nThrough Michelangelo’s personal writings, letters, and poetry that include recollections of his wet nurse it is known that Michelangelo was very emotionally engaged to the motherhood of Mary, relating the Virgin Mother to his own wet nurse. It is believed that although the work was commissioned, the Medici Madonna is largely tied to his own deep rooted personal issues.",

Its name distinguishes it from his Great Holy Family, also in the Louvre. It is signed and dated 'RAPHAEL VRBINAS S[anti] PINGEBAT MDXVIII' on the hem of the Madonna's garment.\\n\\nAccording to the 17th century writer André Félibién two further Louvre works Abundance and Ceres, both in monochrome, formed a cover to the Small Holy Family. Abundance has a signature 'Raphael Uvrbinas', though this is usually considered a later addition. It may relate to cardinal Bibbiena, whose surname was 'Dovizi[a]' (i.e. Abundance). It is a rare survival of a painting for so small a painting. It shows a figure in a niche on a base between marble mirrors, with a mask under the base, referring to an Aphrodite (Kunsthistorisches Museum) originally in the Loggia dei Marmi in the Palazzo Ducale di Mantova. \\nThe work and its cover may have been commissioned from Raphael around 1519 by Pope Leo X as thanks for the services of Adrien Gouffier de Boissy, papal legate to France. de Boissy also owned John the Baptist as a Young Man in the Desert (Louvre), another work by Raphael and assistants, as well as a preparatory drawing for the Small Holy Family now in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle. In 1622 it was recorded in the collection of the Count of Brienne, who then left it to Louis XIV. \\nElizabeth's face and the cradle in the shape of an inverted tree trunk are reminiscent of other works by Raphael from that era such as Holy Family under an Oak Tree (Prado) and La Perla (Prado), both with assistance from Giulio Romano. The background landscape is influenced by the Danubian School.",

Like other paintings of this subject, it has sometimes been considered to represent Judith with the Head of Holofernes, the other biblical incident found in art showing a female and a severed male head .  Historically, the main figure has also been called Herodias, the mother of Salome.\\nSometimes attributed to Giorgione, the painting is now usually seen as one where Titian's personal style can be seen in development, with a 'sense of physical proximity and involvement of the viewer', in which 'expert handling of the malleable oil medium enabled the artist to evoke the sensation of softly spun hair upon creamy flesh'.Erwin Panofsky suggested the head of John the Baptist might be a self-portrait, and it is possible that Titian was alluding to his private life with the model, anticipating Cristofano Allori's, Judith with the Head of Holofernes (1613, Royal Collection, and other versions), where the severed head was a self-portrait and Judith and the maid portraits of his ex-mistress and her mother.  The model here, allowing for a degree of idealization, has been said to be the same used in the Dresden Venus (Giorgione and Titian, c. 1510).This composition was copied many times, in some cases at least by Titian's workshop.\\n\\n",

It was a popular model for artists such as Andrea del Sarto, Fra' Bartolomeo and Lorenzo Lotto in the 1510s, although another altarpiece was commissioned from Rosso Fiorentino for the chapel.In Pescia Cathedral by the mid 16th century, Raphael's work was acquired by prince Ferdinando de' Medici in 1697. He had it restored and completed by the brothers Niccolò and Agostino Cassana. Ferdinando wished Raphael's work to act as a pendant to another work in his collection, Fra' Bartolomeo's Christ Among the Doctors, and so had a strip added to the top of Raphael's work to make it the same height as the other painting. Raphael's work was taken to Paris in 1799 and only returned to Florence in 1813.",

The painting is in the form of a tondo, meaning in Italian, 'round', a shape which is frequently associated during the Renaissance with domestic ideas.The work was most likely created during the period after Doni's marriage in 1503 or 1504, and before the Sistine Chapel ceiling frescoes were begun in 1508. The Doni Tondo portrays the Holy Family (the child Jesus, Mary, and Joseph) in the foreground, along with John the Baptist in the middle-ground, and contains five nude male figures in the background. The inclusion of these nude figures has been interpreted in a variety of ways.",

It is a painting made for display in a home rather than a church.It is close to compositions by Titian's former master Giovanni Bellini, especially, when reversed, one of 1509 in the Detroit Institute of Arts, and has been seen as a challenge to the much older master, by taking on a characteristic compositional formula of his.  The style is much indebted to Giorgione, and it was often attributed to him in the earlier 20th century.  This is especially so in the 'harmonious fullness and slow gravity of form' of the figure of the Virgin, which uses a type of figure Titian did not repeat in later Madonnas.  The landscape is virtually identical to the left-most section of the background of the Dresden Venus, traditionally thought to have been begun by Giorgione, but with the landscape done after his death in 1510 by Titian.The right background is occupied with a cloth of honour, painted with careful attention to its folds (they were often stored folded up).  These were hung behind thrones, as in very many paintings of enthroned Madonnas, and here it implies that an unoccupied throne is out of sight to the right.  The Bellini in Detroit uses the same device.  The composition is therefore a half-way stage between the older more formal enthroned Madonnas and newer compositions with the Virgin and Child shown informally in a landscape setting.  Madonnas by Bellini and his followers had for some time been showing small glimpses of landscape to the sides of the painting, usually cut off by a parapet lower down, and the formula here, using a horizontal 'landscape' format, develops this.",

It was exhibited in the Tribuna in 1677 and attributed to Giorgione in 1709, as shown on a label on the back of the painting. It was then moved to the villa di Poggio a Caiano. After several subsequent moves, in 1798 it finally arrived back Uffizi.\\nOxidisation in the paint in the 19th century made attribution difficult. Joseph Archer Crowe, Cavalcaselle and Giovanni Morelli could not decide on the work's artist, Otto Mündler (1869) argued it was by Pietro della Vecchia and Roberto Longhi that it was by Paris Bordone - other critics shifted between Giorgione and Titian as the artist.

    "abstract": "The Risen Christ, Cristo della Minerva in Italian, also known as Christ the Redeemer or Christ Carrying the Cross, is a marble sculpture by the Italy High Renaissance master Michelangelo, finished in 1521. It is in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome, to the left of the main altar.\\nThe work was commissioned in June 1514, by the Roman patrician Metello Vari, who stipulated only that the nude standing figure would have the Cross in his arms, but left the composition entirely to Michelangelo. Michelangelo was working on a first version of this statue in his studio in Macello dei Corvi around 1515, but abandoned it in roughed-out condition when he discovered a black vein in the white marble, remarked upon by Vari in a letter, and later by Ulisse Aldrovandi. A new version was hurriedly substituted in 1519-1520 to fulfil the terms of the contract. Michelangelo worked on it in Florence, and the move to Rome and final touches were entrusted to an apprentice, Pietro Urbano; the latter, however, damaged the work and had to be quickly replaced by Federico Frizzi at the suggestion of Sebastiano del Piombo.\\n\\nThe first version, rough as it was, was asked for by Metello Vari, and given him in January 1522, for the little garden courtyard of his palazzetto near Santa Maria sopra Minerva, come suo grandissimo onore, come fosse d'oro translated as 'As his greatest honor, as if it were of gold', a mark of the esteem in which Michelangelo was held'. There it remained, described by Aldrovandi in 1556, and noted in some contemporary letters as apparently for sale in 1607, following which it was utterly lost to sight. In 2000 Irene Baldriga recognized the lost first version, finished in the early seventeenth century, in the sacristy of the church of San Vincenzo Martire, at Bassano Romano near Viterbo; the black vein is clearly distinguishable on Christ's left cheek.  It is now often called the Giustiniani Christ.  The parts finished later are the 'right hand, parts of the face and the back'.Despite all these problems, the second version impressed the contemporaries. Sebastiano del Piombo declared that the knees alone were worthy of more than the whole Rome, which William Wallace has called 'one of the most curious praises ever sung about a work of art' Christ is shown by Michelangelo unclothed in a standing pose. Christ's sexual organs are exposed in order to show that his sexuality is uncorrupted by lust and completely controlled by his will, so that in his resurrected body he shows his triumph over both sin and death. During the Baroque period a bronze floating loincloth was added.\\nA leg is flexed and the head turned back, according to the principle of contrapposto.  Compared to the first version, the more active pose allows more varied impressions when the statue is seen from different angles, 'not only activating the space around him, but also suggesting an unfolding story'.  The first version was exhibited in the National Gallery, London in 2017, in the same room as a cast of the second version, drawings for it, and letter relating to it.",

It shows the Madonna and Child with John the Baptist, St Elisabeth and in the background St Joseph. It is now in the Museo del Prado. It is quite badly damaged and from Giovanni Battista Cavalcaselle onwards it is held to have been painted by Romano after Raphael's death using sketches made by the latter artist - others argue it was painted around 1518. Part of another version has recently been found in the galleria Estense in Modena, known as the Perla di Modena.\\nIt may be identifiable with the painting mentioned in Vasari's Lives of the Artists as owned by the counts of Canossa, then sold to cardinal Luigi d'Este, given to Caterina Nobili Sforza, countess of Santafiora and finally ceded by her to Vincenzo I Gonzaga in exchange for a marquisate worth 50,000 scudi. Another theory holds that it is the work identified as a Madonna which Gonzaga acquired directly from the counts of Canossa in exchange for the fiefdom of Cagliano in Monteferrato in 1604.\\nThe painting definitely passed to Charles I of Great Britain in 1627 and after his execution it was bought at auction by Philip V of Spain, who gave it its current name, since he saw it as 'the pearl' of his collection. It was taken to Paris in 1813 by Joseph Bonaparte and it remained there until 1815.",

Lorenzo Lotto was inspired  by this work for his Recanati Annunciation.\\nThe painting depicts the Annunciation in a church with a chessboard pavement.

The decorative programme included other major paintings celebrating Bacchus and Venus, the gods of wine and love.

A sleeping nymph and a urinating boy are seen in the lower right foreground while men and women celebrate with jugs of wine. The absence of Bacchus from the painting is explained by Erwin Panofsky, who suggests that the god must be on the departing ship seen in the center background. Due to the artistic liberties Titian took in painting these figures, it is difficult to identify them. The musical score in the foreground is the canon Chi boyt et ne reboyt il ne seet que boyre soit ('who drinks and does not drink again does not know what drinking is'), attributed to Ferrarese court musician Adrian Willaert.The Bacchanal of the Andrians has been admired by other artists including Rubens who copied it in versions that are housed at the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm.",

On this occasion, women would make offerings to representations of the goddess so as to  cleanse 'every blemish on their bodies'.In Titian's work, two nymphs, one young and one matronly, are situated to the right of the ceremony, attending to a shrine holding a representation of Venus. The shrine is surrounded by votive tablets. The older woman checks on the decorations with the use of a mirror which she holds high in her extended right hand. The foreground of the canvas is thronged with a swarm of male infants, or putti, who distract themselves in activities such as climbing trees, leaping, flying, gathering apples, lying around, fighting, fondling, shooting arrows and pulling each other's hair. A dam is shown in the middle background, near a sunlit meadow. The far distance is decorated with a mountain and blue sky.\\nTitian based the image on the writings of the Greek sophist Philostratus. In his 'Imagines I, VI', Philostratus wrote, 'See cupids are gathering apples: and if there are many of them, do not be surprised...The cupids' quiver are studded with gold, and golden also are the darts in them...they have hung their quivers on the apple trees; and in the grass lie their broidered mantles...Ah, the baskets into which they gather their apples!'",

It illustrates the Biblical creation narrative from the Book of Genesis in which God gives life to Adam, the first man. The fresco is part of a complex iconographic scheme and is chronologically the fourth in the series of panels depicting episodes from Genesis.\\nThe image of the near-touching hands of God and Adam has become iconic of humanity. The painting has been reproduced in countless imitations and parodies. Michelangelo's Creation of Adam is one of the most replicated religious paintings of all time.",

It was previously attributed to the school of Titian, perhaps an autograph work by his brother Francesco Vecellio or by Polidoro Lanzani.

    "abstract": "The Madonna of Bruges is a marble sculpture by Michelangelo of the Virgin and Child.\\nMichelangelo's depiction of the Madonna and Child differs significantly from earlier representations of the same subject, which tended to feature a pious Virgin smiling down on an infant held in her arms.  Instead, Jesus stands upright, almost unsupported, only loosely restrained by Mary's left hand, and appears to be about to step away from his mother.  Meanwhile, Mary does not cling to her son or even look at him, but gazes down and away.  It is believed the work was originally intended for an altar piece.  If this is so, then it would have been displayed facing slightly to the right and looking down. The early 16th-century sculpture also displays the High Renaissance Pyramid style frequently seen in the works of Leonardo da Vinci during the late 1400s.\\nMadonna and Child shares certain similarities with Michelangelo's Pietà, which was completed shortly before – mainly, the chiaroscuro effect and movement of the drapery.  The long, oval face of Mary is also reminiscent of the Pietà.\\nThe work is also notable in that it was the only sculpture by Michelangelo to leave Italy during his lifetime.  In 1504, it was bought by Giovanni and Alessandro Moscheroni (Mouscron), who were wealthy cloth merchants in Bruges , then one of the leading commercial cities in Europe.  The sculpture was sold for 4,000 florins.\\nThe sculpture was removed twice from Belgium after its initial arrival.  The first was in 1794 after French Revolutionaries had conquered the Austrian Netherlands during the French Revolutionary Wars; the citizens of Bruges were ordered to ship it and several other valuable works of art to Paris. It was returned after Napoleon's final defeat at Waterloo in 1815. The second removal was in 1944, during World War II, with the retreat of German soldiers, who smuggled the sculpture to Germany enveloped in mattresses in a Red Cross truck. It was discovered a year later in Altaussee, Austria within a salt mine and again returned.  It now sits in the Church of Our Lady in Bruges, Belgium. This is part of the fact-based movie The Monuments Men.\\n\\n",

Known for its realism and attention to detail, the image is reminiscent of works by Hans Holbein the Elder, by whom Raphael may have been influenced in its execution. Stylistically, it relates to Raphael's Portrait of Agnolo Doni, ca.1506, in what Claudio Strinati described in 1998 as its 'merciless clarity.'The subject of the painting, Tommaso Inghirami, was a friend of Raphael's, a prelate nicknamed Phaedra following a skillful exhibition of Latin poetry improvisation during a performance of Seneca's Phaedra wherein he carried the title role. A popular orator and actor, Tommaso Inghirami had strabismus. According to 2005's Cambridge Companion to Raphael, the piece is 'the first likeness into which Raphael introduced the concept of movement', in the twist of his body as he contemplates his composition. By means of this device, Raphael focused attention away from his subject's disfigurement.",

Among the Lombard painters who have been suggested as possible authors are Cesare da Sesto, Marco d'Oggiono, Francesco Melzi, and Cesare Bernazzano. The painting shows a male figure with garlanded head and leopard skin, seated in an idyllic landscape. He points with his right hand off to his left, and with his left hand grasps his thyrsus and also points down to earth.\\nThe painting originally depicted John the Baptist. In the late 17th century, between the years 1683 and 1693, it was overpainted and altered to serve as Bacchus.Cassiano dal Pozzo remarked of the painting in its former state, which he saw at Fontainebleau in 1625, that it had neither devotion, decorum nor similitude, the suavely beautiful, youthful and slightly androgynous Giovannino was so at variance with artistic conventions in portraying the Baptist – neither the older ascetic prophet nor the Florentine baby Giovannino, but a type of Leonardo's invention, of a disconcerting, somewhat ambiguous sensuality, familiar in Leonardo's half-length and upward-pointing Saint John the Baptist, also in the Louvre.The overpainting transformed the image of St. John into one of a pagan deity, by converting the long-handled cross-like staff of the Baptist to a Bacchic thyrsus and adding a vine wreath. The fur robe is the legacy of John the Baptist, but has been overpainted with leopard-spots relating, like the wreath, to Bacchus, the Roman god of wine and intoxication.",

The work is one of the earliest known paintings by the artist, executed between 1499 and 1502. It is  probably a piece of an unknown predella, though it has been suggested that the painting could be one of the remaining works of the Baronci altarpiece, Raphael's first recorded commission (seriously damaged by an earthquake in 1789, fragments of which are today found in museums across Europe). The painting is now in the São Paulo Museum of Art.\\nThe Kinnaird Resurrection is one of the first preserved works of Raphael in which his natural dramatic style of composition was already obvious, as opposed to the gentle poetic style of his master, Pietro Perugino. The extremely rational composition is ruled by a complex ideal geometry which interlinks all the elements of the scene and gives it a strange animated rhythm, transforming the characters in the painting into co-protagonists in a unique 'choreography'. The painting possesses an esthetic influence from Pinturicchio and Melozzo da Forlì, though the spatial orchestration of the work, with its tendency to movement, shows Raphael's knowledge of the Florentine artistic milieu of the 16th century.The work was acquired by the São Paulo Museum of Art in 1954. Pietro Maria Bardi, former director of the museum, took the responsibility of adding the  Kinnaird Resurrection to the body  of works of Raphael, based on the existence of two preparatory studies for the composition, starting a heated debate about its authorship. Nowadays, the reference to Raphael is almost unanimously accepted by experts. It is the only work by that artist currently in the Southern Hemisphere.",

Some scholars have attributed it to Leonardo da Vinci but the attribution and the work's authenticity have been disputed.Some of those who disagree with the attribution to Leonardo believe the portrait is by an early 19th-century German artist imitating the style of the Italian Renaissance, although radiocarbon dating tests show a much earlier date for the vellum. It has also been denounced as a forgery. The white lead has been dated to be at least 225 years old. The work sold for just under $22,000 at auction in 1998, and was bought by its current owner Peter Silverman in 2007. He has championed the attribution to Leonardo, supported by the analysis of academics Martin Kemp and Pascal Cotte. \\nThe drawing was shown as a Leonardo in an exhibition in Sweden in 2010 and was estimated by various newspaper reports to be worth more than $160 million. The Bella Principessa remains locked in a vault in a secret Swiss location.According to Kemp and Cotte, the sheet was cut from a Milanese vellum book, La Sforziada,  in Warsaw, which celebrates the marriage in 1496 of Galeazzo Sanseverino with Bianca, the illegitimate daughter of Ludovico Sforza, Leonardo's employer. It has subsequently been exhibited in Urbino, Monza and Nanjing; and a facsimile edition of the portrait and the book in Warsaw has been published.",

It is in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica in Palazzo Barberini, Rome.\\nIt is probable that the picture was in the painter's studio at his death in 1520, and that it was modified and then sold by his assistant Giulio Romano. In the 16th century the picture was in the house of the Countess of Santafiora, a Roman noblewoman, and subsequently became property of the Duke Boncompagni and then of the Galleria Nazionale which still possesses it.\\nThe woman is traditionally identified with the fornarina (baker) Margherita Luti, Raphael's Roman lover, though this has been questioned. The woman is pictured with an oriental style hat and bare breasts. She is making the gesture to cover her left breast, or to turn it with her hand, and is illuminated by a strong light coming from outside. Her left arm has a narrow band carrying the signature of the artist, RAPHAEL URBINAS.  It has been suggested that the right hand on the left breast reveals a cancerous breast  tumour disguised in a classic pose of love. Another speculation is that she is touching her left breast to remind herself which side she last fed her child on, the child being Raphael's.X-ray analyses have shown that in the background was originally a Leonardesque-style landscape in place of the myrtle bush, which was sacred to Venus, goddess of love and passion.  An overpainted ruby ring on the sitter's third left finger has caused speculation on whether there might have been a secret marriage with Raphael.",

Venus, said to have been born from a shell, is identified by the shell at bottom left. It is smaller than usual in the birth of Venus scenes, such as Botticelli's, and is just intended to identify the subject rather than be a boat-like vessel for Venus, as in Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus and other depictions.  \\nThe voluptuousness of the Venus presented, and her sideways glance, also owes much to the Crouching Venus and Cnidian Venus types of antique sculpture.  The wringing of her hair is a direct imitation of Apelles's lost masterwork of the same title.  Titian deliberately included this detail to prove that he could rival the art of antiquity in which the goddess was also washing her hair — a fact mentioned in Pliny's Natural History. \\nThe painting is in exceptionally fine condition.  It was once owned by Christina of Sweden, and passed via the Orleans Collection to 6th Duke of Sutherland, who lent it and 26 other paintings to the National Gallery of Scotland in 1945.  On the death of the childless Duke in 2000, the work was acquired from his cousin, Francis Egerton, 7th Duke of Sutherland for more than £11m in 2003, with the aid of the National Arts Collection Fund.  Also contributing to the purchase were the Wolfson Foundation, the Heritage Lottery Fund (£7.6m), and the Scottish Executive (£2.5m).  To facilitate the sale, £2.4m of the picture's value was offset against inheritance tax.  The market value has been estimated at £20m. After the sale, the 7th Duke said, 'To all intents and purposes nothing has changed, except the painting will now belong to the nation.' \\nIt soon afterwards formed the centrepiece of an exhibition in 2004 and the anniversary exhibition 'Saved!' for the National Art Collections Fund.",

If this is correct, she may have commissioned it or it may have been commissioned by someone wishing to praise her. \\nWitnessing the vision are Antony the Great to the left and Louis of Toulouse to the right - the Battuti ran a hospital for the poor and sick so Antony (often prayed to for cures) and Louis (who renounced all worldly honours, including the throne of France) are apt choices. Lotto shows the influence of Perugino and others by creating a sense of movement through cutting off the top point of the mandorla. The landscape in the background may be based on Feltre, specifically the bell tower and church of its Santuario dei Santi Martiri Vittore e Corona on a rise to the left, its system of bridges in the centre and its castle (as it would have appeared just before its destruction in the War of the League of Cambrai in 1510) to the right",

    "abstract": "St. George and the Dragon is a small cabinet painting by the Italian High Renaissance artist Raphael, painted between 1504 and 1506, and now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The saint wears the blue garter of the English Order of the Garter, reflecting the award of this decoration in 1504 to Raphael's patron Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, by King Henry VII of England. The first word of the order's motto, 'HONI' can be made out.  The painting was presumably commissioned by the Duke, either to present to the English emissary who brought the regalia to Urbino, Sir Gilbert Talbot, or to Henry himself—recent scholarship suggests the latter. The honour paid to a minor Italian ruler reflected Henry's appreciation of the cultural prestige of Renaissance Italy as much as any diplomatic purpose.\\nThe traditional subject, Saint George and the Dragon, combining chivalry and Christianity, is appropriate for the occasion; like his father, Guidobaldo was a condottiero, or proprietor of a band of mercenary soldiers. In the early stages of his career Raphael painted a number of tiny cabinet paintings, including another St George in the Louvre, and the Vision of a Knight in the National Gallery in London.",

It is one of a cycle of paintings on mythological subjects produced for Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, for the Camerino d'Alabastro – a private room in his palazzo in Ferrara decorated with paintings based on classical texts. An advance payment was given to Raphael, who originally held the commission for the subject of a Triumph of Bacchus. At the time of Raphael's death in 1520, only a preliminary drawing was completed and the commission was then handed to Titian. In the case of Bacchus and Ariadne, the subject matter was derived from the Roman poets Catullus and Ovid.\\nThe painting, considered one of Titian's greatest works, now hangs in the National Gallery in London. The other major paintings in the cycle are The Feast of the Gods (mostly by Giovanni Bellini, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C), and Titian's The Bacchanal of the Andrians and The Worship of Venus (both now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid).",
