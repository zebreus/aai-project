    "abstract": "Convent Thoughts is a painting by the Pre-Raphaelite painter Charles Allston Collins which was created between 1850 and 1851. Collins sent it to the Royal Academy of Arts in 1851 where it was exhibited.\\nThe painting shows a nun contemplating a passion flower symbolising the crucifixion of Christ. She is standing in a walled garden full of minutely detailed flowers. In her left hand she holds an illuminated missal, held not as though she had been reading it but so as to show us the Annunciation and the Crucifixion. Her costume shows that she is a novice, presumably meditating on her final vows.\\nThe flowers were painted in the Oxford garden of Thomas Combe, an early collector of Pre-Raphaelite paintings, and the model was his housemaid, Frances Sarah Ludlow, later Mrs Brucker. Combe bought the painting; in 1894 he bequeathed his art collection to the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford and Convent Thoughts remains in the Museum's collection.Although Collins was never formally a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, he was in sympathy with their aims and painted in their immensely detailed style. Convent Thoughts has a place in the history of Pre-Raphaelitism, because the tide of opinion, initially hostile, was to some extent turned by a letter to The Times on 13 May 1851 from the influential critic John Ruskin praising the Pre-Raphaelite paintings at the Academy exhibition, in particular Convent Thoughts, about which he wrote:\\n\\n'I happen to have a special acquaintance with the water plant Alisma Plantago ... and as I never saw it so thoroughly or so well drawn, I must take leave to remonstrate with you, when you say sweepingly that these men 'sacrifice truth as well as feeling to eccentricity.' For as a mere botanical study of the Water Lily and Alisma, as well as of the common lily and several other garden flowers, this picture would be invaluable to me, and I heartily wish it were mine.'\\n\\nIn a curious footnote to this story, it has recently been pointed out that there is in fact no Alisma Plantago in the picture.",

    "abstract": "The Love Potion is a 1903 painting by Evelyn De Morgan depicting a witch with a black cat familiar at her feet.\\nAccording to Elise Lawton Smith, the painting 'exhibits a Pre-Raphaelite fascination with medieval subjects and decorative detailing.'\\nThe Love Potion pushed the boundaries of society's expectations of women by “exploring the nature of female authority through the practice of sorcery.' The painting differs from most of De Morgan's earlier works by featuring a sorceress as the subject, rather than a Christian or mythological figure. The sorceress is dressed in an ornate gold gown, which is symbolic of her mastery of skill and the final stage of the alchemical system of progression toward salvation.  Her mastery is further evidenced by the leather bound books on the shelf which were popular alchemy texts during the late nineteenth century. \\nFurthermore, the subject is seated in a position making her profile visible which creates a sense of intensity and authority. Her intent stare is fixated on the potion she is mixing in her chalice, which mirrors the gold and sapphire blue seen on her gown.\\nThis repetition of color reinforced the idea that whatever potion she is cooking up is for personal gains. There is also a couple embracing in the background, directly above the chalice which suggests that the potion may also have to do with them. This idea is further supported by the piece of white cloth draped on the bench behind the sorceress, which looks like it’s the missing piece from the woman’s dress.\\nIn the foreground of the work is a black cat which has little definition other than the perfectly round, glowing green eyes. These eyes are mirrored by the green circular glass detail above the subject which gives the illusion of many eyes watching the sorceress at work. The cat also resembles the cat seen in the foreground of Edouard Manet's painting Olympia, in which the cat is a symbol of prostitution. Although the sorceress in De Morgan's work is probably not a prostitute, the purpose of the cat may still work to symbolize similar taboo practices such as alchemy, which was also frowned upon in Edwardian society. The setting sun seen in the background further suggests something illicit is taking place by creating a mysterious setting.\\nThe Love Potion is a textbook example of De Morgan's characteristic use of bold colors and strong female imagery. Although the subject matter differs slightly from the majority of her works, it is a display of her style and her impeccable attention to detail.",

    "description": "Burne-Jones's magnum opus",
    "abstract": "The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon is a painting by Edward Burne-Jones, started in 1881. The massive painting measures 279 cm × 650 cm, and is widely considered to be Burne-Jones's magnum opus.The painting was originally commissioned from Burne-Jones by his patron George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle, to hang on a wall in the library of Naworth Castle. Howard shared Burne-Jones's affection for the Arthurian legend and left the choice of topic to the artist. Burne-Jones started working on it in 1881 and continued for 17 years. Within this period, he also designed the stage set for the play King Arthur by J. Comyns Carr that premiered in London in January 1895.The 1880s brought the deaths of Burne-Jones's close friends. As they died, the artist experienced mounting isolation and painful awareness of his own mortality. Immersed in his work, Burne-Jones identified himself with Arthur and even adopted Arthur's pose when he himself slept. By 1885, the association with Arthur reached the point where Burne-Jones had to ask Howard to cancel or revise his original commission, replacing the grand scene with a smaller painting focused on the departed king. Howard agreed to cancellation and never requested his downpayment back. Nevertheless, Burne-Jones returned to the original grand painting, and worked on it for the remaining thirteen years of his life. Arthur became increasingly autobiographical for the artist as he withdrew into himself; 'above all the picture is about silence.'\\nHow is it you are in Avalon, where I have striven to be with all my might — and how did you get there and how does Arthur the King? ...\\n\\nA popular opinion holds that Burne-Jones modelled Arthur's appearance after William Morris, the last survivor of a once-strong progressive art circle, and that Morris's physical decline was a major inspiration for the painting. However, Debra Mancoff argues that there is no record of Morris posing as Arthur and that the king's image was completed when Morris was in vigorous health. Morris died in 1896; Burne-Jones lived for two more years and died before the painting was complete. Just one day before his death Burne-Jones continued work on Arthur. Towards the end of his life he wrote, 'I need nothing but my hands and my brain to fashion myself a world to live in that nothing can disturb. In my own land I am king of it.' His widow described Arthur as a 'task of love to which [the artist] put no limit of time or labour.'Following the artist's death, the painting in its frame with Latin inscription passed to a neighbour of Burne-Jones's, whose descendants, John and Penryn Monck, sold the work at auction at Christie's on 26 April 1963 where it was bought by Luis A. Ferré, a politician and founder of the Ponce Museum of Art who would later become Governor of Puerto Rico. Burne-Jones was out of fashion at this time so its export was allowed despite some objections.\\nThe Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon is owned by the Ponce Museum of Art in Puerto Rico.  However, it was shown for a short time at Tate Britain in London in 2009–10 while the Ponce museum underwent restoration.  The painting was also on view at that time at the Prado Museum in Madrid for the exhibition The Sleeping Beauty: Victorian Painting from The Museo de Arte de Ponce (2 February 2009 - 31 May 2009).",

    "abstract": "Manfred on the Jungfrau is an 1842 oil-on-canvas painting by Ford Madox Brown. It is inspired by Act I Scene II of Lord Byron's dramatic poem Manfred, probably most particularly the following:\\n\\n... And you, ye crags upon whose extreme edge I stand, and on the torrent's brink beneath \\nBehold the tall pines dwindled as to shrubs \\nIn dizziness of distance, when a leap, \\nA stir, a motion, even a breath, would bring \\nMy breast upon its rocky bosom's bed \\nTo rest for ever – wherefore do I pause? \\n... Thou winged and cloud-cleaving minister, \\nWhose happy flight is highest into heaven, \\nWell may'st thou swoop so near me ... \\n... How beautiful is all this visible world! \\nHow glorious in its action and itself!\\n\\nThe painting depicts the central character of the poem, Manfred, who is a noble and wealthy aristocrat, about to toss himself from the heights of the Jungfrau mountain. Manfred is, however, saved from death by a chamois hunter who happens upon him, and who is seen approaching in the background of the painting, clad in fur.\\nThe detail seen on Manfred's face shows his deep psychological agony, and the reason for his desire for suicide.In 1837, John Martin painted an artwork of the same name. Martin's version was a watercolour, and focused more on the Jungfrau mountain than on the detail of Manfred and the hunter.",

He is showing a stuffed bird, a king bird of paradise, to a group of children and a woman. The older girl on the left of the picture is holding a resplendent quetzal, and other specimens are scattered about. The attitude of the children ranges from the enthralled interest of the youngest two to the comparative indifference, almost boredom, of the oldest girl.The work was inspired by a visit that Millais and his son John Guille Millais paid to the ornithologist John Gould shortly before his death in 1881. On the way home, Millais said to his son 'That's a fine subject; a very fine subject. I shall paint it when I have time.' It was in fact several years after Gould's death before he had time, and the picture as painted is not a representation of Gould or of the actual scene during Millais' visit – the central figure was modelled by the engraver Thomas Oldham Barlow, a friend of the artist, two of the others are professional models, and the two smallest children are Millais' grandchildren (one of whom is William Milbourne James).\\nThe painting was well received – the influential critic Ruskin said that it was one of 'only three things worth looking at' in the R.A. exhibition.",

    "abstract": "Victory O Lord! (1871) is a painting by John Everett Millais depicting Moses, Aaron and Hur during the Battle of Rephidim against the Amalekites. Along with his landscape Chill October it represented a major turning point in Millais's career.\\nThe painting illustrates a passage in the Book of Exodus, chapter 17, which describes how Moses and his two companions watched the battle from the hill. Moses holds the Rod of God in his right hand.\\n\\nAnd Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand. So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.\\nMillais depicts the 'going down of the sun', when the three patriarchs watch the final moments of the battle. Moses is in the middle while Aaron and Hur hold up his arms to ensure victory. Aaron, in red, is on the right. The battle below is indicated by the arrow at the bottom right.  \\nMillais worked on the painting over many years, scraping and repainting the surface. F.G. Stephens commented that the painting depicted the conflict between the unyielding and steadfast willpower of Moses, and the physical and emotional exhaustion of his companions. He also praised the vivid painting of the aged flesh of the figures. The painting contrasts dramatically in style with the contemporary religious works of Millais's former companion, William Holman Hunt, such as The Shadow of Death, on which Hunt was working at the same time; however, it has been suggested that both pictures may refer to typological prefigurations of the crucifixion in scenes in which raised, outstretched arms signify both physical suffering and triumph..",

    "abstract": "Isabella and the Pot of Basil is a painting completed in 1868 by William Holman Hunt depicting a scene from John Keats's poem Isabella, or the Pot of Basil. It depicts the heroine Isabella caressing the basil pot in which she had buried the severed head of her murdered lover Lorenzo.\\nHunt had drawn an illustration to the poem in 1848, shortly after the foundation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, but he had not developed it into a completed painting. The drawing portrayed a very different scene, depicting Lorenzo as a clerk at work while Isabella's brothers study their accounts and order around underlings.\\nHunt returned to the poem in 1866, shortly after his marriage, when he began to paint several erotically charged subjects. His sensuous painting Il Dolce Far Niente had sold quickly, and he conceived the idea for a new work depicting Isabella. Having travelled with his pregnant wife Fanny to Italy, Hunt began work on the painting in Florence. However, after giving birth, Fanny died from fever in December 1866. Hunt turned the painting into a memorial to his wife, using her features for Isabella. He worked on it steadily in the months after her death, returning to England in 1867, and finally completing it in January 1868. The painting was purchased and exhibited by the dealer Ernest Gambart.\\nThe painting portrays Isabella, unable to sleep, dressed in a semi-transparent nightgown, having just left her bed, which is visible with the cover turned over in the background. She drapes herself over an altar she has created to Lorenzo from an elaborately inlaid prie-dieu over which a richly embroidered cloth has been placed. On the cloth is the majolica pot, decorated with skulls, in which Lorenzo's head is interred. Her abundant hair flows over the pot and around the flourishing plant, reflecting Keats's words that Isabella 'hung over her sweet Basil evermore,/And moistened it with tears unto the core.'  Behind her, next to the doorway, are a pair of pattens, next to the edge of a cassone.\\n\\nThe emphasis on sensuality, rich colours and elaborate decorative objects reflects the growing Aesthetic movement and similar features in the work of Hunt's Pre-Raphaelite associates John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, such as Millais's Pot Pourri and Rossetti's Venus Verticordia. The pose of the figure also resembles Thomas Woolner's sculpture Civilization, which was partly modelled by Fanny's sister Alice.\\nHunt's work influenced several later artists, who adopted the same subject. Most notable are the paintings by John White Alexander (1897) and John William Waterhouse (1907). Alexander and Waterhouse reproduce Hunt's title and develop variations on his composition. Alexander's composition adapts the subject to a Whistlerian style. Waterhouse reverses the composition, and places the scene in a garden, but retains the motif of the water-jug and the decorative skull.",

    "abstract": "Ligeia Siren is a chalk drawing by Dante Gabriel Rossetti (DGR) that was completed in 1873. The painting depicts a siren, a creature from classic Greek mythology, that also appear in tales such as Homer's Odyssey or Virgil's Georgics. The drawing is predominantly inspired from Rossetti's own 1869 libretto The Doom of the Sirens with which Ligeia is one of the female leads. Instead of depicting the traditional encounter of the siren with her victims entranced by her beauty and powers of music, doomed to a terrible fate, as in The Siren (1900) by John William Waterhouse or Ulysses and the Sirens (1909) by Herbert James Draper. Rossetti depicts a timeless moment, where contrary to his depiction of her in his libretto, she appears tranquil and relatively innocuous to her intended victims in the background.In his extremely detailed documentation of his brother's life and works, William Michael Rossetti documented DGR writing of Ligeia Siren as 'certainly one of my best things' and though it was only a drawing done in chalk that it was 'quite an elaborate picture.'  The body is that of an unknown woman, however face of the drawing is that of model Alexa Wilding, with whom Rossetti drew and painted often and can be seen as the subject of many of his works at this time such as La Ghirlandata and Veronica Veronese. She is standing amongst vegetation. with an exotic instrument, staring out into the distance. The bird on the instrument acts to identify the female figure as a siren from antiquity, as they were originally depicted with wings or 'birds inhabited by soulds of the dead.\\n\\n",

The painting was submitted to the Royal Academy of Arts for display in the Summer Exhibition of 1868 but it was rejected – most likely for internal politics and jealousies rather than artistic reasons. The picture was accepted the following year and reviewed very favourably by The Times, which commented pointedly on its previous failure to win a place.Medea was modelled on Keomi Gray, a Romani woman whom Sandys had met in Norwich, England, and taken back to London to sit for many of his paintings. According to a contemporary critic it shows the enchantress Medea '...in the act of incantation, the baleful light of her chafing-dish playing in the folds of her robe, and making the pale cheeks look paler, and the ashy lips more ashy, and kindling the array of foul ingredients and witch's properties that surround her tripod - foul toads and strange roots, and images of strange gods, and quaint shells filled with evil compounds.'In 1911 the picture was among paintings representative of the best British art sent to Italy for the international exhibition at Rome held in honour of the jubilee of the Kingdom of Italy.",

Waterhouse painted it in 1884; according to Anthony Hobson, 'The Illustrated London News described it as one of the principal works of the year'. Hobson describes the work as having a 'keyhole composition' because a partial ring of women focus upon a single other (the priestess).Hobson goes on to say that the painting helps 'to establish Waterhouse as a classical painter' because of his use of 'classical, geometrical structures...the vertical, the horizontal and the circle'. When he adds the diagonal, as 'in the inclined figure of the priestess' and the out-of-place rug, it is a deliberately added tension.",

    "abstract": "The Golden Stairs is one of the best-known paintings by the Pre-Raphaelite artist Edward Burne-Jones.  It was begun in 1876 and exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1880.Unlike many of Burne-Jones's works, The Golden Stairs is not based on a literary source. It has been called Symbolist, as it has no recognisable narrative, but rather sets a mood.  It is a harmony of color in the tradition of the Aesthetic works of the 1860s and 1870s, as a group of young women carrying musical instruments descend a spiraling staircase, dressed in classically inspired robes in tones of white, shading to gold and silver. Critic F. G. Stephens wrote in The Athenaeum that the musicians 'troop past like spirits in an enchanted dream ... whither they go, who they are, there is nothing to tell'.The Golden Stairs was one of many paintings Burne-Jones sketched out in 1872 following a trip to Italy.  He began work on the canvas in 1876 and finished it in great haste in April 1880, just days before the Grosvenor Gallery exhibition was to open.  Stephens found in the painting echoes of the work of Piero della Francesca, whose frescoes Burne-Jones had seen and copied in 1871. The figures of the musicians were drawn from professional models, but the heads are young women of Burne-Jones's circle. Some identifications have been made as follows.\\nHis daughter Margaret is fourth from top, holding a trumpet. Edith Gellibrand, known by the stage name Edith Chester, is seventh from top, seen stooping. May Morris, daughter of William Morris, is ninth from top, holding a violin. Frances Graham, later known as Lady Horner, daughter of William Graham, is bottom left, holding cymbals. Standing behind her on the stairs is Mary Gladstone, daughter of William Gladstone. Others include Laura Tennant, later known as Laura Lyttelton, and Mary Stuart-Wortley, later Lady Lovelace.The painting was purchased by Cyril Flower (1843–1907), later Lord Battersea, a politician and art patron, and was bequeathed by him to the Tate Gallery, where it remains.",

It is a fancy portrait depicting Jonathan Swift's  close friend and correspondent Esther Vanhomrigh (1688-1723), who was known by that nickname, which Swift himself invented for her.Vanessa represents a major departure in Millais's art because he abandons fully for the first time the detailed finish that was still to be seen in Waking and Sleeping, exhibited in the previous year. Influenced by the work of Diego Velázquez and Joshua Reynolds, Millais paints with dramatic, visible brush strokes in vivid colours, creating what has been described as an 'almost violently modern' handling of paint.Esther Vanhomrigh is known as 'Swift's Vanessa' because of the fictional name he gave her when he published their correspondence. The portrait is wholly imaginary. No  image of Esther Vanhomrigh  survives   and we  know very little about her actual appearance, although  she was said 'not to be a beauty'.  She is holding a letter, presumably written to or from Swift. Her sad expression is related to the fraught nature of the relationship, which was broken up by Swift's relationship with another woman, Esther Johnson, whom he called 'Stella', whom he may have married secretly.  Vanessa died soon afterwards. Millais also painted a companion piece depicting Stella.\\nThe painting is part of the 18th century revival in British art at this time, when a renewed interest in the brushwork of Reynolds and Gainsborough was emerging.",

    "abstract": "Work (1852–1865) is a painting by Ford Madox Brown that is generally considered to be his most important achievement. It exists in two versions. The painting attempts to portray, both literally and analytically, the totality of the Victorian social system and the transition from a rural to an urban economy. Brown began the painting in 1852 and completed it in 1865, when he set up a special exhibition to show it along with several of his other works. He wrote a detailed catalogue explaining the significance of the picture.\\nThe painting was commissioned by Thomas Plint, a well-known collector of Pre-Raphaelite art, who died before its completion.  A second version, smaller at 684 × 990 mm, was commissioned in 1859 and completed in 1863. This is now in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.  It is closely similar, though for the lady with a blue parasol the face of Maria Leathart, the commissioner's wife, replaces that of Mrs Brown in the Manchester version.The picture depicts a group of so-called 'navvies' digging up the road to build a tunnel. It is typically assumed that this was part of the extensions of London's sewerage system, which were being undertaken to deal with the threat of typhus and cholera. The workers are in the centre of the painting. On either side of them are individuals who are either unemployed or represent the leisured classes. Behind the workers are two wealthy figures on horseback, whose progress along the road has been halted by the excavations.The painting also portrays an election campaign, evidenced by posters and people carrying sandwich boards with the name of the candidate 'Bobus'. A poster also draws attention to the potential presence of a burglar.The setting is an accurate depiction of The Mount on Heath Street in Hampstead, London, where a side road rises up above the main road and runs alongside it. Brown made a detailed study of the location in 1852.",

She is shown with pale, luminous and delicate skin (fitting in with the aestheticism of the time) and a hard penetrating gaze. She holds a feather fan over her right shoulder as well wearing many kinds of jewellery, picked by the painter to show off his painterly skill – a red coral necklace, rings and earrings. In her hair are two spiral shell-shaped hairclips, accessories particularly loved by Rossetti and used here to emphasize the painting's circular composition. Rossetti's own opinion of the painting was that it was 'probably the most effective as a room decoration that I have ever painted'.",

    "abstract": "King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid is an 1884 painting by the Pre-Raphaelite artist Edward Burne-Jones.  The painting illustrates the story of  'The King and the Beggar-maid', which tells the legend of the prince Cophetua who fell in love at first sight with the beggar Penelophon. The tale was familiar to Burne-Jones through an Elizabethan ballad published in Bishop Thomas Percy's 1765 Reliques of Ancient English Poetry and the sixteen-line poem The Beggar Maid by Alfred, Lord Tennyson.Burne-Jones first attempted the story in an oil painting of 1861–62 (now in the Tate Gallery, London). He was working out a new composition around 1874 or 1875, and began the painting in earnest in 1881. He worked on it through the winter of 1883–84, declaring it finished in April 1884.\\nThe composition is influenced by Andrea Mantegna's Madonna della Vittoria (1496–96). Several studies for the final work survive.  A small gouache (bodycolour) of c. 1883 (now in the collection of Andrew Lloyd Webber) shows the king and the beggar maid much closer together, and a full-scale cartoon in bodycolour and coloured chalks of the same year (now in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery) features an entirely different approach to lighting the figures.\\nKing Cophetua was exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1884 and became Burne-Jones's greatest success of the 1880s for its technical execution and its themes of power and wealth overborne by beauty and simplicity.  It was heralded as the 'picture of the year' by The Art Journal and 'not only the finest work Mr Burne-Jones has ever painted, but one of the finest pictures ever painted by an Englishman' by The Times.  The painting was exhibited in France in 1889, where its popularity earned Burne-Jones the Legion of Honour and began a vogue for his work.  The artist's wife Georgiana Burne-Jones felt 'this picture contained more of Edward's own qualities than any other he did.'The painting was purchased by the Earl of Wharncliffe (d. 1899) and acquired by public subscription through the Burne-Jones Memorial Fund from his executors in 1900.  It is now in Tate Britain. The full-scale cartoon was acquired for Birmingham in 1947.\\nThe painting is referenced in Chapter 4 of Anthony Powell's 'Books do Furnish a Room', the tenth instalment of 'A Dance to the Music of Time', as a visual set-up for the confrontation between X Trapnel and Kenneth Widmerpool in the former's digs in  bombed out Little Venice circa 1947.  Pamela Widmerpool is envisioned as the Beggar Maid.",

It shows the bride walking in the garden with female personifications of the two winds blowing towards her.  On each side of the bride are white lilies, symbolising her virginity.  The pose of the bride is inspired by Botticelli's figures.  The painting is based on an earlier design by Burne-Jones for a tapestry.Sponsa de Libano forms part of the Victorian collection in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.  It is painted in gouache and tempera on paper and measures 332.5 centimetres (131 in) by 155.5 centimetres (61 in).  The picture was purchased by the gallery in 1896.  In the same year the gallery purchased a study for the painting.  This had been prepared in about 1891, drawn in chalk on paper, and shows the head used for one of the winds.  The model was a twelve-year-old Jewish girl, who modelled for both winds, and was told to 'look wild and blow with your lips'.  The study is now held by the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight, Merseyside.",

The passage illustrated is from the Gospel of Luke, 2:41, which states:\\n\\nEvery year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover. When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom. After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, 'Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.' 'Why were you searching for me?' he asked. 'Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?' But they did not understand what he was saying to them.\\nHunt depicts the moment at which Mary and Joseph find Jesus, while the rabbis in the temple are reacting in various contrasting ways to his discourse, some intrigued, others angry or dismissive. This depiction of contrasting reactions is part of the tradition of the subject, as evidenced in Albrecht Dürer's much earlier version. Hunt would also have known Bernardino Luini's version of the subject in the National Gallery. At the time this was ascribed to Leonardo da Vinci.",

Merlin is shown trapped, helpless in a hawthorn bush as Nimue reads from a book of spells.The work was commissioned from Burne-Jones by Frederick Richards Leyland, a Liverpool ship-owner and art-collector, in the late 1860s. After a false start blamed on 'poor materials', Burne-Jones began work on the painting proper in 1873, finishing the body of the work by the end of 1874; however, the painting was not first exhibited until 1877 at the opening exhibition of the Grosvenor Gallery in London.Burne-Jones used Maria Zambaco, who was probably his mistress from 1866 to 1872, for the model for the head of Nimue.The Beguiling of Merlin was purchased by Lord Leverhulme in 1918 and remains in the Lady Lever Art Gallery to the present day.The painting features on the covers of the books Possession: A Romance (1990), by A. S. Byatt, and Fiona MacCarthy's biography of Burne-Jones, The Last Pre-Raphaelite (2011).

    "abstract": "Hope is a late oil painting by the Pre-Raphaelite artist Edward Burne-Jones.  It was painted on commission for Mrs. George Marston Whitin of Whitinsville, Massachusetts in 1896.Mrs. Whitin originally requested a painting of a dancing figure, but Burne-Jones, devastated by the recent death of his long-time friend and partner William Morris, struggled with the work and wrote to ask if a painting of Hope would be an acceptable alternative.  The result was an allegory in the Renaissance fashion, with the bound personification of Hope reaching skyward despite her bars.The painting is based on an 1871 watercolour by Burne-Jones.  The watercolour is likely painted over the original cartoon for one of a set of stained glass designs of the Christian virtues Faith, Hope, and Charity created by Burne-Jones for Morris, Marshall, Faulknor and Company.  A three-light window based on Burne-Jones's designs was commissioned for the nave of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. The stained glass designs were also used for a set of windows at St Margaret's Church, Hopton-on-Sea, Norfolk and St Martin's Church, Brampton, Cumbria.\\nThe oil painting of Hope was donated to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston by Mrs. Whitin's daughters in her memory.",

It illustrates Ferdinand's lines 'Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?'. He is listening to Ariel singing the lyric 'Full fathom five thy father lies'. Ariel is tipping Ferdinand's hat from his head, while Ferdinand holds on to its string and strains to hear the song. Ferdinand looks straight at Ariel, but the latter is invisible to him.\\nThe painting was Millais' first attempt at the plein air Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood style, which he did at Shotover Park near Oxford. He wrote to his close friend and Pre-Raphaelite colleague Holman Hunt that he had painted a 'ridiculously elaborate' landscape. Referring to Hunt's belief in devotion to detail he wrote that 'you will find it very minute, yet not near enough for nature. To paint it as it ought to be would take me a month a weed — as it is, I have done every blade of grass and leaf distinct.'He painted the face of Ferdinand from another Pre-Raphaelite, Frederic George Stephens. The clothing and the pose are derived from plate 6 of Camille Bonnard's Costumes Historiques, which represents the costume of a 'young Italian' of the fifteenth century.The supernatural green bats were the last additions to the composition. Their grotesque poses put off the patron who had originally undertaken to buy it, since they were a radical departure from the standard sylph-like fairy figures of the day. They adopt the poses of 'see, hear, speak no evil.' \\nThe invisibility of Ariel and the bats is suggested by their semi-merger with the green background. The connection with natural camouflage is implied by the presence of the green lizards hiding in front of the clump in the right foreground.\\nThe painting was bought by the collector Richard Ellison, and later entered the collection of Roger Makins, 1st Baron Sherfield who acquired several Millais paintings.",

The mirror also forms a halo behind the mother's head, and the pattern on the wallpaper suggests the starry heavens.

The mirror resembles the circular mirror in van Eyck's painting, which reflects an image of the artist looking at the couple in the image.\\nThe woman is wearing crinolines, which expand to cover the whole of the lower part of the painting. Brown has left this part incomplete, roughly squaring up and sketching the dress in outline. The title is written on the unfinished dress, underneath the child at the right.\\nBrown's own wife was pregnant whilst he was painting this picture and she gave birth to a son which they named Arthur.   Arthur then died at just ten months old  and it is considered Brown was unable to complete the painting through grief for his son, so he abandoned it.",

Painted with oil paints on a 47-by-47-inch (1,200 mm × 1,200 mm) square canvas, it is widely considered to be Leighton's magnum opus, showing his classicist nature. It is thought that the woman portrayed alludes to the figures of sleeping nymphs and naiads the Greeks often sculpted.\\nFlaming June disappeared from view in the early 1900s and was rediscovered only in the 1960s. It was auctioned shortly after, during a period of time known to be difficult for selling Victorian era paintings, where it failed to sell for its low reserve price of US$140 (the equivalent of $1,126 in modern prices). After the auction, it was promptly purchased by the Museo de Arte de Ponce in Ponce, Puerto Rico, where it currently resides.",

The children are carrying heavy burdens of wood for winter fuel. Though the title refers to the medieval poem Sir Isumbras, the painting does not illustrate a scene from the original text. However Millais's friend, the writer Tom Taylor, wrote verse in a pastiche of the original poem, describing the event depicted. This was included in the original exhibition catalogue.\\nThe background of the painting is based closely on a ruined medieval bridge which stood in Bridge of Earn, Perthshire (since demolished).  Some of the village houses (in Back Street) can also be seen, though the tower house or castle to the left is imaginary.\\nWhen first exhibited the painting was extremely controversial, and was attacked by many critics. Most notably, Millais's former supporter John Ruskin declared it to be a 'catastrophe'. The painting was also satirised in a print by Frederic Sandys, entitled 'A Nightmare', in which Millais himself was represented as the knight. His fellow Pre-Raphaelites Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt were caricatured as the children, and the horse—transformed into a donkey—was branded with the initials of Ruskin.\\n\\n",

She is shown as a 'powerful and evil temptress' and as 'an iconic, Amazon-like female with long, flowing hair.'Rossetti overpainted Cornforth's face, perhaps at the suggestion of his client, shipping magnate Frederick Richards Leyland, who displayed the painting in his drawing room with five other Rossetti 'stunners.'  After Leyland's death, the painting was purchased by Samuel Bancroft and Bancroft's estate donated it in 1935 to the Delaware Art Museum where it is now displayed.\\nThe painting forms a pair with Sibylla Palmifera, painted 1866–70, also with Wilding as the model.  Lady Lilith represents the body's beauty, according to Rossetti's sonnet inscribed on the frame.  Sibylla Palmifera represents the soul's beauty, according to the Rossetti sonnet on its frame.\\nA large 1867 replica of Lady Lilith, painted by Rossetti in watercolor, which shows the face of Cornforth, is now owned by New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. It has a verse from Goethe's Faust as translated by Shelley on a label attached by Rossetti to its frame:\\n\\n'Beware of her fair hair, for she excellsAll women in the magic of her locks,And when she twines them round a young man's neckshe will not ever set him free again.'",

    "abstract": "The Rescue (1855) is a painting by John Everett Millais depicting a fireman rescuing three children from a house fire, with their mother receiving them back into her arms.\\nMillais witnessed the death of a fireman in the course of a rescue, and decided to depict the subject. The fire brigade had only recently been transformed from private businesses dedicated to the protection of property to a public institution charged to protect life first.Millais sought to create the correct effects of light and smoke by using a sheet of coloured glass and by burning planks of wood. This emphasis on fleeting effects of colour and light was a new departure in his art.\\nThe painting is also notable for its startling transitions of colour, particularly the dramatic effect by which the sleeve of the mother's nightgown changes from slatey blue to pale pink. This led to much critical comment at the time.Robyn Cooper argues that some criticism of the painting arose from the fact that it depicted a virile working class man rescuing middle class children, while their father is nowhere to be seen. The mother's opened arms seem to greet this strong new man as much as her children.\\n\\n",

    "abstract": "The Lady of Shalott looking at Lancelot is an oil-on-canvas painting by John William Waterhouse, completed in 1894.  It measures 142.2 by 86.3 centimetres (56.0 in × 34.0 in).  The artist presented it to Leeds Art Gallery in 1895.\\nIt is the second of three major paintings by Waterhouse that depicts scenes from the Tennyson poem, 'The Lady of Shalott', between the first - The Lady of Shalott - in 1888 and the third - I Am Half-Sick of Shadows, Said the Lady of Shalott - in 1915.  \\nIn Tennyson's poem, the Lady is confined to a tower on an island near Camelot, cursed not to leave the tower or look out of its windows.  She weaves a tapestry, viewing the outside world only through reflections in a mirror behind her.  The painting depicts the pivotal scene in the third part of the poem: the Lady spies 'bold Sir Launcelot' in her mirror: the sight of the handsome knight and the sound of him singing draws her away from her loom to the window, golden yarn still clinging around her knees, bringing down the curse upon her as 'the mirror crack'd from side to side'.  She leaves the tower to take a boat across the river, but meets her death before she reaches Camelot.\\nThe cracked mirror reveals part of the scene, echoing a device used in William Holman Hunt's 1853 painting The Awakening Conscience and also in Hunt's version of The Lady of Shalott (1882-1905).\\nThe Victoria and Albert Museum holds Waterhouse's sketchbook with preliminary drawings for his 1888 and 1894 paintings of the Lady of Shalott.  A study is held by Falmouth Art Gallery.  An oil sketch for the painting was sold after his death in 1917 and disappeared.  It was rediscovered in 2003 in Iceland, having been bought in London by a fisherman many years before.  It was shown in a photograph of Waterhouse held by the National Portrait Gallery, and differs in some ways from the final painting, in which the lady wears a white dress: the dress is red in the sketch.  Waterhouse chose a red dress for his third painting of the Lady of Shalott, I Am Half-Sick of Shadows, Said the Lady of Shalott.  The sketch was sold in 2003.",

They are resting by the roadside after a rainstorm, before travelling to the town of Winchelsea, visible in the background.The painting has been interpreted as an allegory of the senses, contrasting the experiences of the blind and sighted sisters. The former feels the warmth of the sun on her face, and fondles a blade of grass, while the latter shields her eyes from the sun or rain and looks at the unusual spectacle of a double rainbow that has just appeared. Some critics have interpreted the rainbow in Biblical terms, as the sign of God's covenant described in Genesis 9:16.When the painting was first exhibited in 1856 it was pointed out to Millais that in double rainbows the inner rainbow inverts the order of the colours. Millais had originally painted the colours in the same order in both rainbows. He altered it for scientific accuracy.A tortoiseshell butterfly rests on the blind girl's shawl, implying that she is holding herself extremely still. The sheet around her neck is captioned 'Pity the Blind'.",

    "abstract": "The Order of Release, 1746 is a painting by John Everett Millais exhibited in 1853. It is notable for marking the beginnings of Millais's move away from the highly detailed Pre-Raphaelitism of his early years. Effie Gray, who later left her husband for the artist, modelled for the principal figure.\\nThe painting depicts the wife of a rebel Scottish soldier, who has been imprisoned after the Jacobite rising of 1745, arriving with an order securing his release. She holds her child, showing the order to a guard, while her husband embraces her.\\nThe Illustrated London News reviewed the painting as follows:\\n\\nIt is time now that we speak of Millais – Millais the Pre-Raffaelite; the 'pretender' Millais that was; the 'usurper' Millais that is; the 'legitimate' Millais that perhaps (much virtue in that little word) may be; and who has certainly a larger crowd of admirers in his little corner in the Middle Room than all the Academicians put together command; …\\nTruth to say, Mr. Millais, in this 'Order of Release' (265), has achieved for himself an 'order of merit' worth more than any academic honour, and has earned a fame which a whole corporate academy might be proud to portion amongst its constituent members. Whilst we admit – nay assert this – we would by no means wish to be understood as enrolling ourselves incontinently of this young artist's 'party' (for there is partisanship in everything, even in art); but simply as asserting that Pre-Raffaelitism (or rather the artists who have been foolishly styled Pre-Raffaelites) is a 'great fact', and perhaps may lead to the regeneration of art in this country; …\\nThe subject is simply that of a wife, with child in her arms, coming with an order of release for her husband, who has been taken in the Civil Wars. The husband, overcome with emotions, and weak from a recent wound (his arm is in a sling), can but fall upon her neck and weep; moan, 'firm of purpose', sheds no tear; she has none to shed; but her eye is red and heavy with weeping and waking; and she looks at the stern and unconcerned gaoler with a proud look, expressing that she has won the reward for all her trouble past. The colouring, the textural execution, are marvellous (for these degenerate days).The dark, generalised background is a departure from the highly detailed backgrounds of earlier works such as Ophelia, as is the emphatic chiaroscuro. However, the portrayal of tense relationships disrupted by historical dramas was a continuation of the theme of A Huguenot and The Proscribed Royalist, 1651.\\nWhile working on the painting, Millais fell in love with Effie, the wife of his principal supporter, the critic John Ruskin. A study for the painting has a drawing of her head on one side and an image of a man kneeling in supplication to a woman on the other, labelled 'accepted'.",

She holds an alabaster ointment cup, a traditional attribute which associates her with the unnamed sinful woman who anointed Jesus' feet in Luke 7:37. Like other Pre-Raphaelite painters, Frederick Sandys gave Magdalene a sensual look. \\nDante Rossetti accused Sandys of plagiarism, because of the resemblance to his Mary Magdalene Leaving the House of Feasting, but when Rossetti came to paint Magdalene some twenty years later, it was his painting that resembled Sandys.Mary Magdalene was acquired in 1894 by Samuel Bancroft, the most important American collector of Pre-Raphaelite art, whose family donated his collection to the Delaware Art Museum in 1935.  Bancroft had bought the painting from Charles Fairfax Murray, an artist in the Pre-Raphaelite circle. \\nIt has been exhibited as part of a touring exhibition of the Bancroft Collection, at the Saint Louis Art Museum, San Diego Museum of Art, the Frick Art & Historical Center in Pittsburgh, Nottingham Castle, and other locations.  It was once featured in an oversize advertisement in the San Antonio International Airport.",

It is from Millais's Aesthetic phase, when he was influenced by the work of Frederic Leighton and James McNeill Whistler. \\nThe painting depicts Esther, the Jewish wife of the Persian king Ahasuerus, as she prepares to enter the presence of her husband. As she is uninvited, she risks death, but does so to inform him of a plot against the Jews.\\nMillais borrowed the Yellow Jacket, a gown given to General Gordon by the Chinese emperor after his defeat of the Taiping rebellion. In order to create a culturally unspecific effect, he turned it inside out, producing the abstract patterns visible in the painting.Millais creates a dramatic visual effect by vivid contrasts of colours, setting the deep blue of the curtain against the yellow dress and the white columns. The minimising of the narrative aspect of the scene is also in line with the Aestheticist approach of the artists he is imitating and challenging.\\nEsther is depicted adjusting pearls in her hair, as she prepares to place her crown on her head. This gesture is derived from paintings by Titian, whose techniques of colouring Millais imitates, along with the modelling of the face and the characteristic 'Titian blonde' hair. This also compares with the lush red locks of Millais's earlier picture The Bridesmaid and with some contemporary works by Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Millais's biographer Marion Spielmann wrote that the painting was 'the most modernly treated of Millais's early works...more consonant in its strong harmony with the audacious brilliancy of the present day [1898] than the more solid strength of forty years ago.'",

For we forget.\\nAh no, no.Originally acquired by William Morris, the painting was purchased by the Tate Gallery, London (now Tate Britain) in 1909 and has remained in the Tate collection to the present day.It shows a distinctly Pre-Raphelite style in which a soft approach to nature and femininity is found.  Bright colors and red-haired women as well as an emphasis on nature and symbolism characterize this style which can be found in the late 1800s as a response to industrialization.\\nThe painting depicts a young couple at a moment of emotional crisis. The male figure is barely visible, his head bent over the young woman's left hand. The woman, tears slightly overflowing, is looking down at fallen blossoms, suggesting the end of spring and of early and young love.\\nThe model for the principal figure was Tryphena Ford, whom Hughes married in 1855.",

Something being buried or exhumed. Twin wreaths. The deep dark earth. Corpses, secrets, conspiracy, fear. It's a picture that pulls out all the stops.'\\nThe painting is one of those satirised in Florence Claxton's watercolour The Choice of Paris – an idyll (1860). Claxton criticized 'the perceived ugliness of early pre-Raphaelite paintings by exaggerating details from many of their works, including The Vale of Rest, Claudio and Isabella, and, lying in the grass, Alice Gray from Spring'",

The model was Fanny Cornforth, the principal inspiration for Rossetti's sensuous figures.\\nThe title, meaning 'mouth that has been kissed', refers to the sexual experience of the subject and is taken from the Italian proverb written on the back of the painting:\\nBocca baciata non perde ventura, anzi rinnova come fa la luna.‘The mouth that has been kissed does not lose its good fortune: rather, it renews itself just as the moon does.’ \\nRossetti, an accomplished translator of early Italian literature, probably knew the proverb from Boccaccio’s Decameron  where it is used as the culmination of the tale of Alatiel: a beautiful Saracen princess who, despite having had sex on perhaps ten thousand occasions with eight separate lovers in the space of four years, successfully presents herself to the King of the Algarve as his virgin bride.Rossetti explained in a letter to William Bell Scott that he was attempting to paint flesh more fully, and to 'avoid what I know to be a besetting fault of mine - & indeed rather common to PR painting - that of stipple in the flesh...Even among the old good painters, their portraits and simpler pictures are almost always their masterpieces for colour and execution; and I fancy if one kept this in view, one might have a better chance of learning to paint at last.'The painting may have been influenced by Millais' portrait of his sister-in-law Sophie Gray, completed two years earlier.",

    "abstract": "Dante's Dream (full title Dante's Dream at the Time of the Death of Beatrice) is a painting from 1871 by the English Pre-Raphaelite painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti. It hangs in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.\\nRossetti had a lifelong interest in the Italian poet Dante Alighieri.  The painting was inspired by Dante's poem La Vita Nuova. In this poem Dante dreams that he is led to the death-bed of Beatrice Portinari, who was the object of his unfulfilled love.  Dante, in black, stands looking towards the dying Beatrice who is lying on a bed.  Two female figures in green hold a canopy over her.  An angel in red holds Dante's hand and leans forward to kiss Beatrice.\\nIn the painting, Rossetti creates a visionary world with complex symbols.  The symbols include the green clothes of Beatrice's attendants, signifying hope; spring flowers in the foreground symbolising purity; and red doves for love.It is Rossetti's largest painting.  The model for Beatrice was Jane Morris, the wife of William Morris. Annie Miller, who is thought to have been one of Rossetti's mistresses, posed as a grieving hand maiden. The Walker Art Gallery bought the painting directly from the artist in 1881 for £1575 (equivalent to £160,000 in 2018).  The acquisition was negotiated by Victorian novelist Hall Caine.  In 1897 it was sent to Berlin to be photographed, but was then noted to be 'in a dirty condition'.  Again in 1904 the painting was noted to be in 'a bad condition' and it was considered that its condition had been worsened by its journey to and from Berlin.  The painting was sent in 1908 to the National Gallery in London to be relined, that is, for a new canvas to be glued to the original.  It was then returned to Liverpool. During the Second World War, it was removed from its stretcher, rolled and stored in the basement of the gallery.  In 1941 the painting was moved, together with other large paintings from the gallery, to Ellesmere College in Shropshire.  It was noted at this time that it had sustained some damage.  Conservation work was carried out on the painting in 1960 and in 1985.Dante's Dream is a painting in oil on canvas, measuring 216 centimetres (85 in) by 312.4 centimetres (123 in).  It was examined in 2003 and found to be in good condition, with no evidence of any recurrence of the former problems.",

The Lady is still confined in her tower, weaving a tapestry, viewing the world outside only through reflections in the mirror in the background.  In the painting, the mirror reveals a bridge over a river leading to the walls and towers of Camelot; also visible nearby are a man and a woman, perhaps the 'two young lovers lately wed' referred to in Tennyson's poem.  The scene is set shortly before an image of Lancelot appears in the mirror, enticing the Lady out of her tower to her death.\\nThe painting shows the Lady of Shalott resting from her weaving.The lady wears a red dress, in a room with Romanesque columns.  The frame of the loom and the geometric tiles of the floor lead the viewer into the room, where the red, yellow and blue colours inside echo those the more vivid colours outside.  The shuttles of the loom resemble boats, foreshadowing the Lady's later death.\\nThe painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1916.  It was sold from the estate of J. G. Griffiths at Hampton's in 1923 for 300 guineas, and passed through the hands of the art dealer Arthur de Casseres.  It was owned by Mr and Mrs Frederick Cowan, and inherited by their great-niece, the wife of Canadian engineer Philip Berney Jackson, who donated to the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1971.",

The Gothic Revival church was designed by architect George Edmund Street in the 1860s and decorated by Morris & Co., the decorative arts firm in which Burne-Jones was a partner.St John's sold The Nativity and its companion painting, known as The King and the Shepherd, in 1989 to pay for a new roof for the church (copies were hung in their places).  The two paintings were acquired for £1.5 million by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, a collector of Victorian art.  In 1997, Lloyd Webber donated the paintings to the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, United States, where his musical Jesus Christ Superstar had premiered in 1971.\\n\\n In this treatment of the birth of Jesus, Burne-Jones places Mary reclining protectively around the infant Jesus while Joseph looks on.  At the left are three angels bearing the symbols of the Passion and Crucifixion, the crown of thorns, a container of myrrh and a chalice. The painting bears an inscription in Latin from the Gallican Psalter (Psalm 11, verse 6) PROPTER MISERIAM INOPUM ET GEMITUM PAUPERIS NUNC EXSURGAM DICIT DOMINUS ['Because of the misery of the poor and the groaning of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord'].\\nSeveral studies for The Nativity have survived. A pencil drawing sold at Sotheby's New York in 2012 places Joseph on the right, while an 1887 pastel sketch in the Garman-Ryan Collection at The New Art Gallery Walsall shows the final composition but a very different colour palette. The position of Mary and Jesus echoes Burne-Jones' design for a bronze relief of the Nativity of 1879.  The relief was commissioned by George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle as part of a monument to his parents for Lanercost Priory, Cumbria.  A drawing of this design is in the Fitzwilliam Museum.",

    "abstract": "A Huguenot, on St. Bartholomew's Day, Refusing to Shield Himself from Danger by Wearing the Roman Catholic Badge. (See the Protestant Reformation in France, vol. ii., page 352) (1851–52) is the full, exhibited title, of a painting by John Everett Millais, and was produced at the height of his Pre-Raphaelite period. It was accompanied, at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 1852, with a long quote reading: 'When the clock of the Palais de Justice shall sound upon the great bell, at daybreak, then each good Catholic must bind a strip of white linen round his arm, and place a fair white cross in his cap.—The order of the Duke of Guise.' This long title is usually abbreviated to A Huguenot or A Huguenot, on St Bartholomew's Day.It depicts a pair of young lovers and is given a dramatic twist because the girl, who is Catholic, is attempting to get her beloved, who is a Protestant, to wear the white armband declaring allegiance to Roman Catholicism. The young man firmly pulls off the armband at the same time that he gently embraces his lover, and stares into her pleading eyes. The incident refers to the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre on August 24, 1572, when around 3,000 French Protestants (Huguenots) were murdered in Paris, with around 20,000 massacred across the rest of France. A small number of Protestants escaped from the city through subterfuge by wearing white armbands.\\nMillais had initially planned simply to depict lovers in a less dire predicament, but supposedly had been persuaded by his Pre-Raphaelite colleague William Holman Hunt that the subject was too trite. After seeing Giacomo Meyerbeer's opera Les Huguenots of 1836 at Covent Garden, which tells the story of the massacre, Millais adapted the painting to refer to the event. In the opera, Valentine attempts unsuccessfully to get her lover Raoul to wear the armband. The choice of a pro-Protestant subject was also significant because the Pre-Raphaelites had previously been attacked for their alleged sympathies to the Oxford Movement and to Catholicism.Millais painted the majority of the background near Ewell in Surrey in the late summer and autumn of 1851, while he and Hunt were living at Worcester Park Farm. It was from a brick wall adjoining an orchard. Some of the flowers depicted in the scene may have been chosen because of the contemporary interest in the so-called language of flowers. The blue Canterbury Bells at the left, for example, can stand for faith and constancy. Returning to London after the weather turned too cold to work out-of-doors in November, he painted in the figures: the face of the man was from that of Millais's family friend Arthur Lemprière, and the woman was posed for by Anne Ryan.\\nThe painting was exhibited with Ophelia and his portrait of Mrs. Coventry Patmore (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge) at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1852, and helped to change attitudes towards the Pre-Raphaelites. Tom Taylor wrote an extremely positive review in Punch. It was produced as a reproductive print by the dealer D. White and engraved in mezzotint by Thomas Oldham Barlow in 1856. This became Millais's first major popular success in this medium, and the artist went on to produce a number of other paintings on similar subjects to serve a growing middle class market for engravings. These include The Order of Release, 1746 (Tate, London), The Proscribed Royalist, 1651 (Lord Lloyd-Webber Collection), and The Black Brunswicker (Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight). All were successfully engraved.\\nThere are smaller watercolor versions of the picture in the Cecil Higgins Art Gallery, Bedford, the Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, and a reduced oil replica in the Lord Lloyd-Webber Collection, all by Millais.",

The painting portrays a scene from the Bible.  Two of Noah's daughters-in-law nurture the dove that has returned to the Ark bearing an olive branch. This is the second of Millais's paintings with biblical themes, following The Eve of the Deluge. Millais had some intention of producing a 'pendant' painting titled The Dove's First Flight, but never did so.Millais's original plan for the painting was to include the figure of Noah, as well as including several animals in the background. The final omission of these other figures is thought to have been due to his desire to have the painting ready for the Royal Academy exhibition of 1851.The Return of the Dove to the Ark was first put on public display at the Royal Academy in April 1851. Millais was surprised to learn that some Roman Catholics who viewed it believed it to be an allegory for the return of the country to the true faith.It was praised by John Ruskin and Théophile Gautier, among others.  Ruskin was so taken with it that he wished to buy it when he first saw it, but it had already been sold to the collector Thomas Combe, superintendent of the Clarendon Press, who owned many other Pre-Raphaelite works of art.  It passed to the Ashmolean as part of the Combe Bequest in 1893.\\nIn 1855, a French satirical magazine, Journal pour rire, printed a cartoon by Bertall parodying Millais's painting.",

    "abstract": "The Long Engagement is a painting by the Pre-Raphaelite artist Arthur Hughes which was created between 1854 and 1859. The painting was originally titled Orlando.The painting depicts a curate and his fiancée in a woodland setting. \\nThe title refers to middle class social conventions of the time, in particular the fact that the parents of a girl engaged to a poorly paid curate would typically not allow the marriage until he had secured a more remunerative position – i.e. within the church hierarchy. The girl is depicted looking at her own name (Amy) carved, some while ago, into the trunk of the tree by her fiancé as an expression of his love. The carving, however, is about to be covered by rambling ivy growing up the trunk; ethereal youthful passion is becoming lost to worldly capitalist demands. It can be said that this symbolism reflects the stark realities of late 1850s and 1860s Victorian England, which certainly is the observation made by English historian A. N. Wilson. In his book The Victorians, Wilson makes the following observation and analysis of the significance of The Long Engagement:\\n\\n[It] depicts an emotional predicament stemming directly from an economic situation. The prosperity which had created the vast bourgeoisie with its gradations from lower to upper middle class had also created a code. You could not marry, and maintain the position in society to which you aspired, until you had a certain amount of money in the bank.\\nHughes had finished an earlier painting, April Love, of a similar theme. The Long Engagement was given to the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery in the will of a 'Dr Griffiths' in 1902, and has remained in the collection to present day.",

    "abstract": "Mariana is an 1851 oil-on-wood painting by John Everett Millais. The image is based on the solitary Mariana from William Shakespeare's Measure for Measure, written between 1601 and 1606. In the play, Mariana was to be married, but was rejected when her dowry was lost in a shipwreck. Her story was retold in 'Mariana', a poem published in 1830 by Tennyson, which provided additional inspiration for Millais' painting. The painting is regarded as an example of Millais' 'precision, attention to detail, and stellar ability as a colorist'.Millais was a founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a group of English artists who came together in 1848 with the goal of renewing British painting. They found in the art of the early Italian Renaissance—before Raphael—a sincerity of purpose and clarity of form that they sought to emulate.\\n Oftentimes the PRB artists used allegorical images to create a narrative, which taught a moral virtue or virtues.  Sometimes they used contemporary literature as inspiration for their paintings, which often include numerous details that allow the viewer to 'read' the painting. Millais used Tennyson's poetry to create a narrative for his painting of Mariana and he wanted to allow the viewer familiar with Tennyson's poetry to read the entire poem through the painting.\\nWhen it was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1851, the display caption contained lines from Tennyson's 'Mariana' (1830):\\n\\nThe painting is packed with details that help the viewer to read the narrative of the work along with Tennyson's poetry.  Everything from the rolled embroidery that Mariana has been working on and the leaves outside of the window point the reader in the direction of the narrative which is about a young woman rejected by her fiancé because her dowry was lost at sea. It is about waiting and the passage of time, which Millais shows by the arched-back pose of the woman.  The pose makes it seem like she has been sitting too long and she must stand up to stretch before she sits again.  The rolled embroidery on the table gives the viewer a clue as to how long Mariana has been working on it.\\nIn the painting Mariana, Millais included many details that relate directly to Tennyson's poetry.  One example is the curtain.  In the poem, Tennyson wrote, 'When thickest dark did trance the sky, She drew her casement-curtain by, and glanced athwart the glooming flats'. Although there is not a curtain in Millais' painting, this line is similar to the scene that is presented outside of the window.  The viewer perceives an ominous feeling, just like the dark storm that Tennyson alludes to in the line above.  The little mouse that is on the floor towards the bottom right corner is a detail that Millais took from Tennyson's poem: 'the mouse behind the mouldering wainscots shriek'd or from the crevice peer'd about'.  Together, Millais' painting and Tennyson's poem create an intriguing storyline for the reader to follow.",

Helena has been removed from the common artistic elements of the Trojan War: despite dealing with a typically bellic topic, De Morgan decides to paint, instead of weapons and battles, the wonderful pink clothes and the fascinated look that Helena puts on the mirror that is reflecting her beautiful face, elements that can be read as symbols of her inconscient vanity, which eventually brought a long and terrible war and destruction to the city of Troy, which we can see in the last term of the composition, on top of a hill. The presence of the moon-sun in the sky is also related to her feminine and voluble nature.",

    "abstract": "Echo and Narcissus is a painting by John William Waterhouse, dating from 1903. It illustrates the poem Echo and Narcissus from Ovid's Metamorphoses.\\nJohn William Waterhouse (1847–1917) was an English painter who, because of his style and themes, has been classified as a Pre-Raphaelite, but is more accurately described as a Neo-Classical painter.  He painted over 200 works, mainly in the genres of classical mythology, and of historical or literary subjects.  One of his common themes is the femme fatale, the woman who ensnares a man.Echo and Narcissus is in the genre of classical mythology.  In Ovid's version of the myth, Narcissus was the son of the river god Cephissus and the nymph Liriope.  His parents were told that he would live to an old age if he did not look at himself.  He rejected all the nymphs and women who fell in love with him.  One of these was the nymph Echo, who was so upset by her rejection that she withdrew from life and wasted away until all that was left was a whisper.  Her prayers were heard by the goddess Nemesis who caused Narcissus to fall in love with his own reflection.  He continued to look at his reflection until he died.  A narcissus flower grew on the spot where he died.\\nThe painting is in oil on canvas and measures 109.2 centimetres (43 in) by 189.2 centimetres (74 in).  It forms part of the Victorian collection in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, Merseyside, England, having been purchased by the museum in 1903.",
