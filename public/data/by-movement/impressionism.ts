      "Head of Saint John the Baptist is a marble sculpture by French artist Auguste Rodin, sculpted in 1887 as part of a series of sculptures based on his Saint John the Baptist, exhibited for the first time in 1880 with great acceptance and recognition from critics.In this sculpture, Rodin decides not to present the fragment as a bust, the most obvious choice, but to set the head on its side on a baptismal font in order to establish a greater reference to the biblical account of John the Baptist and to separate it from the rest of the fragment that would later be nicknamed The Walking Man, which had been stripped of all religious tendencies.\\nAfter Rodin decides to separate the sculpture based on the strong criticism it received, he realizes that he can imbue gestures in several discrete instants beginning with the separation of the head from the rest of the body; some authors have cited this as one of several examples of Rodin's achievement of stopping time as a counter-statement to the usage of photography in gestures.",

      "The Avenue in the Rain is a 1917 oil painting by the American Impressionist painter Childe Hassam. It depicts Fifth Avenue in New York City in the rain, draped with US flags. The painting is one of six works by Hassam in the permanent art collection of the White House in Washington DC.\\nBetween 1916 and 1919, Hassam completed around 30 paintings of streets decorated with flags. This work dates to February 1917, shortly before the US joined the First World War, at a time when patriotic fervour was rising in the US. The previous month, Germany extended its unrestricted submarine warfare to neutral ships, including vessels bearing the US flag.  The Zimmermann Telegram became public knowledge at the end of February 1917, and the US declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917.\\nThe painting measures 42 by 22.25 inches (106.7 cm × 56.5 cm) and is dominant by red and blue and whites tones, representing the stars and stripes. Several dark figures in the middle distance hold umbrellas, and while the far distance fades into the blue background. The flags seem to float in mid-air, flying from poles that project out from the buildings on the street, but the buildings are not visible. The flags and human figures are reflected on the wet street and sidewalk. Hassam may have been influenced by two similar works of Claude Monet depicting national celebrations in Paris on 30 June 1878.\\nIt was donated to the White House in 1963 by Thomas Mellon Evans and hung between the windows in John F. Kennedy's blue-themed President's Bedroom (now a private sitting room, adjacent to the Yellow Oval Room on the second floor), and then in the President's Dining Room for many years.

      "The Seine at Port-Marly, Piles of Sand (French La Seine à Port-Marly, tas de sable) is an 1875 painting by Alfred Sisley. It was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in 1900 whilst in the collection of Dr. Georges Viau, a Paris dentist and art collector. By 4 March 1907 it was owned by Durand-Ruel, who tried and failed to auction it on 4 March that year. \\nIt was bought by the galerie Bernheim-Jeune in April 1920 and later by Martin A. Ryerson. In 1933 Ryerson left it to its present owner, the Art Institute of Chicago, where it is now in section 201 (Impressionists) on the 1st floor of the Art Institute of Chicago.As in his Drying Nets and The Seine at Argenteuil of three years earlier, it shows the River Seine as a workplace near Port-Marly. This contrasts with most of the rest of his work which - like the other Impressionists - showed the Seine as a place of leisure.At the centre of the painting two men on a flat-bottomed barge dredging the Seine to create a navigable channel for péniches travelling between Le Havre and Paris, the main means of transporting goods in that era. The ochre colours of the sand contrast with the turquoise blue of the water. Sisley shows the town's paper factory, though (unlike in his 1875 The Sand Quay, Port-Marly) he has removed its chimney, showing the smoke emerging from the opening in the gable. He was interested in the sand-extraction industry and painted this and several other works on the quayside at Port-Marly itself.",

      "The Boy in the Red Vest (Le Garçon au gilet rouge), also known as The Boy in the Red Waistcoat, is a painting (Venturi 681) by Paul Cézanne, painted in 1889 or 1890. It is a fine example of Cézanne's skilled, nuanced, and innovative mature work after 1880.\\nCézanne painted four oil portraits of this Italian boy in the red vest, all in different poses, which allowed him to study the relationship between the figure and space. The most famous of the four, and the one commonly referred to by this title, is the one which depicts the boy in a melancholic seated pose with his elbow on a table and his head cradled in his hand. It is currently held in Zürich, Switzerland. The other three portraits, of different poses, are in museums in the US.The Foundation E.G. Bührle, which currently owns the work, notes the painting's picturesqueness, adding that 'There is a perfect balance here of high compositional intelligence and spontaneous painterly intuition.' In 1895, art critic Gustave Geffroy said it could stand comparison with the finest figure paintings of the Old Masters.The colors of the painting are rich, dense, and festive. The composition is organized with three main diagonals: the angle of the boy's tilted back and head, the angle of the deep-green curtain behind the boy, and the long angle of the seat and table rising from the lower left. These three angles are countered by the angles of the boy's thighs and arms, creating a tightly articulated structure of intersecting diagonals.This painting was acquired from Cézanne by art dealer Ambroise Vollard, probably in 1895, and successively acquired by art collectors Marcell Nemes in 1909 and Gottlieb Reber in 1913. Art collector and patron Emil Georg Bührle purchased it from Beber in 1948. Following Bührle's death in 1956, his heirs donated the painting to the Foundation E.G. Bührle in 1960.In February 2008, the painting was stolen from the Foundation E.G. Bührle in Zurich.\\nIt was the museum's most valuable painting and was valued at $91 million. It was recovered in Serbia in April 2012.",

It is exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago.The Impressionist painting depicts a steam train from Normandy arriving at the Gare Saint-Lazare railway station in Paris, with crowds of people waiting amid the steam and smoke under the vaulted iron and glass vault of the station's train shed.  It was painted en plein air, at the station.  It measures 60.3 cm × 80.2 cm (23.7 in × 31.6 in) and is signed and dated in the lower left corner, 'Claude Monet 77'.The painting is one of 12 works by Monet depicting a scene at the station, and it was also one of eight that he exhibited at the Third Impressionist Exhibition in Paris in April 1877.  It was sold to Ernest Hoschedé in March 1877, but was in the possession of Georges de Bellio the following year.  On his death in 1894, it was inherited by de Bellio's daughter Victorine and her husband Ernest Donop de Monchy.  Sold to the Bernheim-Jeune gallery around 1899, it passed through the hands of the art dealer Paul Rosenberg and then the Durand-Ruel gallery in Paris in 1911, which took the painting to New York.  It was sold later in 1911 to the wealthy businessman and art collector Martin A. Ryerson for US$7,000.  On his death in 1932, it was bequeathed to the Art Institute of Chicago.",

      "Argenteuil is an 1874 oil on canvas painting by Édouard Manet (1832-1883), first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1875. It is one of Manet's first works to qualify fully as an Impressionist work, due to its naturalistic subject and its bold palette, such as the blue of the river, mocked by the Figaro journalist Jean Rousseau as 'in the foreground, Argenteuil jam on an indigo river' It is now in the Musée des beaux-arts in Tournai, Belgium.\\nFrom 1872 onwards Manet's themes and brighter palette were echoing those of Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir. He spent summer 1874 in Gennevilliers and took the chance to visit his friend Monet, who had lived at Argenteuil since 1873. The surrounding villages beside the Seine were then full of Impressionist painters - as well as Manet and Monet, Renoir frequently travelled there and Gustave Caillebotte was based at Petit-Gennevilliers. He also produced The Monet Family in their Garden (1874, New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art) and Claude Monet Painting in his Studio (1874, Munich, Neue Pinakothek) in the open air that summer whilst in close contact with Monet.\\nThe work shows a man in a boater and a young woman sitting beside the Seine at Argenteuil (now in Val-d'Oise) - the village is in the background. Manet asked Claude Monet and his wife Camille to pose for the painting but they could not hold the pose for long enough. Manet's brother-in-law Rudolf Leenhoff or baron Barbier (a friend of Guy de Maupassant) was probably the model for the man, though the model for the woman is unknown.",

      "Snow at Argenteuil  (French: Rue sous la neige, Argenteuil) is an oil-on-canvas landscape painting from the Impressionist artist Claude Monet. It is the largest of no fewer than eighteen works Monet painted of his home commune of Argenteuil  while it was under a blanket of snow during the winter of 1874–1875. This painting—number 352 in Wildenstein’s catalogue of the works of Monet—is the largest of the eighteen. The attention to detail evident in the smaller paintings is less evident in this larger picture. Instead, Monet has rendered large areas of the canvas in closely like tones and colours of blue and grey. The application of smaller strokes of greens, yellows, reds and darker blues breaks up these large expanses, and the almost choreographed dispersal of these various colours helps bind the picture together. Paint at the depicted road surface is thicker than elsewhere in the painting, and impasto is suggestive of the feel of disturbed snow.Most of Monet’s Snow at Argenteuil pictures from the winter of 1874–1875 were painted from locations close to the house on the boulevard Saint-Denis (now number 21 boulevard Karl Marx) into which Monet and his family had just moved. This particular painting shows the boulevard Saint-Denis looking in the direction of the junction with the rue de la Voie-des-Bans, with the river Seine out of sight to the rear, and the local railway station behind Monet’s back as he painted.In December 1879 the painting was acquired from Monet by Théodore Duret. Recalling a conversation with the artist Édouard Manet, Duret years later reported that, ‘One winter he [Manet] wanted to paint a snow scene. I had in my possession just such a piece from Monet. After seeing it, he said “It is perfect! I would not know how to do better”, whereupon he gave up painting snow.’ The picture was acquired from Duret by the art dealers Boussod, Valadon et Cie of Paris in 1892; then by Harris Whittemore of Naugatuck, Connecticut in 1893. Acquavella Galleries of New York acquired the painting in the early 1970s, and then it was purchased by Simon Sainsbury in or around 1973. It was bequeathed by him to the National Gallery, London, in 2006 and it has remained there since.",

      "The Cliff Walk at Pourville is an 1882 painting by the French Impressionist painter Claude Monet. It currently resides at the Art Institute of Chicago. It is a landscape painting featuring two women atop a cliff above the sea. \\nThe canvas was inspired by an extended stay at Pourville in 1882. Monet settled in the village between February and mid-April, during which time he wrote to his future wife, Alice Hoschedé, 'How beautiful the countryside is becoming, and what joy it would be for me to show you all its delightful nooks and crannies!' They returned in June of that year. The two young women standing atop the cliff may be Hoschedé's daughters, Marthe and Blanche; it has also been suggested that the figures represent Alice and Blanche, both of whom painted out of doors at that time.The various elements of the painting are unified through brushwork; short, crisp strokes were used to paint the grasses of the cliff, the women's drapery and the distant sea. A sense of movement suggested by painterly calligraphy was a property of Monet's work in the 1880s, and is here used to connote the effect of a summer wind upon figures, land, water, and clouds moving across the sky. During the painting process, Monet reduced the size of a rocky promontory at far right, to better balance the composition's proportions; however, it's also been noted that this secondary cliff was a late addition to the canvas, and was not part of the original design. An X-ray of the painting indicates that the artist originally painted a third figure into the grouping, then removed it.Describing similar works by the artist, art historian John House wrote, “His cliff tops rarely show a single sweep of terrain. Instead there are breaks in space; the eye progresses into depth by a succession of jumps; distance is expressed by planes overlapping each other and by atmospheric rather than linear perspective- by softening the focus and changes of color.” The sense of immediacy is heightened by the juxtapositions of the cliff and sea, the contrast between ground and openness.",

    description: "painting by Gustave Caillebotte",
    abstract:
      "Les raboteurs de parquet (English title: The Floor Scrapers) is an oil painting by French Impressionist Gustave Caillebotte. The canvas measures 102 by 146.5 centimetres (40.2 in × 57.7 in). It was originally given by Caillebotte's family in 1894 to the Musée du Luxembourg, then transferred to the Musée du Louvre in 1929. In 1947, it was moved to the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume, and in 1986, it was transferred again to the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, where it is currently displayed.Caillebotte’s originality lay in his attempt to combine the careful drawing, modeling and exact tonal values encouraged by the Académie with vivid colors, bold perspectives, keen sense of natural light and modern subject matter of the Impressionist movement. Painted in 1875, this work illustrates Caillebotte's continued interest in perspective and everyday life. In the scene, the observer stands above three workers on hands and knees, scraping a wooden floor in a bourgeois apartment—now believed to be Caillebotte's own studio at 77, rue de Miromesnil, in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. A window on the back wall admits natural light. The workers are all shown with nude torsos and tilted heads, suggesting a conversation. Caillebotte’s interest in the male nude, set in a modern context, has been linked to his presumed homosexuality, however it was part of a larger trend, not necessarily limited to homosexual artists, that was first introduced by Courbet in a painting of two wrestlers (Szépmüvézeti Museum, Budapest). This is one of the first paintings to feature the urban working class. It reintroduces the subject of the male nude in the painting, but in a strikingly updated form. Instead of the heroes of antiquity, here are the heroes of modern life—sinewy and strong—in stooped poses that would appear demeaning if they did not convey a sense of masculine strength and honest labor. There is a motif of curls in the image, from the wood shavings on the floor, to the pattern of ironwork in the window grill to the arched backs and arms of the workers. The repetition in the image, with the three workers engaged in different aspects of the same activity but having similar poses, is similar to works by Caillebotte's contemporary, Edgar Degas.\\n\\nDespite the effort Caillebotte put into the painting, it was rejected by France's most prestigious art exhibition, the Salon, in 1875. The depiction of working-class people in their trade, not fully clothed, shocked the jurors and was deemed a 'vulgar subject matter'. He was hurt by this rejection, and instead showed it at the second exhibition of the Impressionists, with whom he had already associated himself, in 1876. He presented it alongside some of his other works, including a second, different version of Raboteurs from 1876, and his earlier work Jeune homme à sa fenêtre (Young Man at His Window) The images of the floor scrapers came to be associated with Degas's paintings of washerwomen, also presented at the same exhibition and similarly scorned as 'vulgar'.The painting divided opinion in Parisian art circles. Among the detractors, Emile Porchoron, a critic of Impressionism, damned Caillebotte with faint praise: 'the least bad of the exhibition. One of the missions Impressionism seems to have set for itself is to torture perspective: you see here what results can be obtained.' Émile Zola praised the technical execution, but then called it 'an anti-artistic painting, painting as neat as glass, bourgeois painting, because of the exactitude of the copying.' Louis Énault was not troubled by the depiction ('The subject matter is certainly vulgar, but we can understand how it might tempt a painter') but did find fault with the image's fidelity to the scene: 'I only regret that the artist did not choose his types better... The arms of the planers are too thin, and their chests too narrow... may your nude be handsome or don't get involved with it!'The painting received praise from many critics, though. Regarding the Salon rejection, poet and critic Émile Blémont called the decision '[a] very bad mark for the official jurors'. Maurice Chaumelin compared Caillebotte favorably to his contemporaries, writing that the work showed that he was 'a realist just as raw, but much more witty, than Courbet, just as violent, but altogether more precise, than Manet.' Philippe Burty made comparisons to an even earlier generation of artists: 'His pictures are original in their composition, but, more than that, so energetic as to drawing that they resemble the early Florentines.'",

Sisley produced it during a four month stay in England, funded and accompanied by his patron the art collector Jean-Baptiste Faure Paradoxically, in cloudy England, Sisley's paintings became brighter and more festive.",

      "The Bust of Victor Hugo is an 1883 patinated plaster sculpture by the French artist Auguste Rodin of the Romantic writer Victor Hugo. It is now in the Museo Soumaya in Mexico City.\\nIn 1883 the journalist Edmond Bazire advised Rodin to cement his reputation by producing a portrait of a notable personality. Rodin thus approached Hugo - he agreed to sittings but refused to sit for longer than 30 minutes. However, he did invite Rodin to stand in the porch of Hugo's house on Avenue d'Eylau in Paris to make additional drawings from a distance whilst Hugo worked in his living room. He made these drawings from different angles between February and April 1883, capturing a range of different angles and expressions. He later made frontal and three-quarter-view engravings.The work in Mexico is the first version of the work, cast in bronze in June 1884 and exhibited at the Paris Salon. Rodin continued to refine the image, producing a second version in 1884 and refining the 1883 work until 1885, around the time of Hugo's death. Rodin used a larger version of the 1883 work to produce his Monument to Victor Hugo in 1887.",

      "Boating on the River Epte (also known as The Canoe on the Epte) is an 1890 oil painting by French impressionist artist Claude Monet. It is currently housed at the São Paulo Museum of Art.\\nBetween 1887 and 1890 Monet concerned himself with portraying scenes from the River Epte, which bathed this property at Giverny. The sisters Suzanne and Blanche Hoschedé posed for this series of pictures, their late father being banker Ernest Hoschedé, a patron of the arts and collector of Monet, and their mother, Alice, who became Monet’s second wife. This series began with La Barque Rose (private collection) and also worthy of mention are canvases La Barque à Giverny (Musée d'Orsay, Paris) and En Barque (National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo). The São Paulo Museum of Art picture, which also has a preparatory study, was mentioned by the artist himself on a letter to critic and friend Geffroy, dated June 22, 1890: “I am again vexed by things that are impossible to do: water with undulating vegetation on the bottom”. In fact one of the more singular characteristics of The Canoe on the Epte in the Monet context is the proximity of the water, which assumes at the lower part of the composition an almost tactile reality, as if the painter for once did not want to depict the luminous reflections of its surface, but its depth. Although it belongs to a series, the masp work is in this particular a unique case. Monet here announces materiality, and it is necessary to remember that this new visual dimension of water will only be obtained again over thirty years later in his paintings of the 1918-1924 period. His friendship with photographer Nadar and his genuine interest in photography explain the framing of the composition as well as the out-of-focus effect produced by the movement of the boat on the water to be seen in the Hoschedé sisters. In addition, a possible source of the São Paulo Museum of Art composition, as has been detected, is the Harunobu engraving, titled Woman Collecting Lotus Flowers.",

It has been cited by several critics as one of his greatest works.It is commonly stated that this was van Gogh's final painting. However, art historians are uncertain as to which painting was van Gogh's last, as no clear historical records exist. The evidence of his letters suggests that Wheatfield with Crows was completed around 10 July and predates such paintings as Auvers Town Hall on 14 July 1890 and Daubigny's Garden. Moreover, Jan Hulsker points out that a painting of harvested wheat, Field with Stacks of Wheat (F771), must be a later painting.",

The work is Degas's only circus painting. Unlike his contemporaries like Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Georges Seurat, the focus is not on the action within the ring or the crowd's reactions; the viewer sees the spectacle as the audience would have done, gazing up at the daring feat taking place above. Degas may have also been seeking to emulate the expansive ceiling paintings by Italian artists such as Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, which he may have seen on his trips to Italy, in painting a highly foreshortened figure.The painting was bought by the trustees of the Courtauld Fund in 1925. It was returned from the Tate Gallery to the National Gallery in 1950.\\n\\n",

The painting is now preserved at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon.\\nThe painting depicts a stormy sea on a winter day. The cliff in the background is at Étretat (Seine Maritime); Monet frequently stayed in the area during the winter of 1864-65, and wrote: 'I spend my time outdoors on the stone when it's big time [...] and of course I work all the time.' Monet composed the painting in February 1883 from his hotel window. Subsequently, the painting was bought by the Parisian dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, and then became the property of the Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon in 1902. The museum was a forerunner in the collecting of early 20th century Impressionist paintings.The painting is composed of four major elements, each painted in a different way. The central part is invaded by the pearlized surfs painted in forms of commas. In the foreground, a small beach on which there are old boats filled with thatch on the left, and two fishermen with their boats in poor condition that ran aground on the shore. On the left, in the background, the cliff of Étretat can be seen and the rock strata are evoked by horizontal lines of brush. Finally, the upper part of the painting shows the sky, painted in a way that expresses a curtain of rain.",

The full-length painting depicts model Lise Tréhot posing in a forest. She wears a white muslin dress and holds a black lace parasol to shade her from the sunlight, which filters down through the leaves, contrasting her face in the shadow and her body in the light, highlighting her dress rather than her face. After having several paintings rejected by the Salon, Renoir's Lise was finally accepted and exhibited in May 1868.\\nThe painting was one of Renoir's first critically successful works.  At this time, Renoir's technique was still influenced by Gustave Courbet, but he continued to develop his unique style painting filtered light which he would return to in The Swing (1876) and Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette (1876).  The almost life-size portrait and unusual contrast in Lise led several critics to ridicule the work.  Théodore Duret, a passionate supporter of the nascent Impressionists, bought the painting from Renoir, who was unable to sell it. Karl Ernst Osthaus, a German patron of avant-garde art, acquired Lise in 1901 for the Museum Folkwang.",

      "The Magpie (French: La Pie) is an oil-on-canvas landscape painting by the French Impressionist Claude Monet, created during the winter of 1868–1869 near the commune of Étretat in Normandy. Monet's patron, Louis Joachim Gaudibert, helped arrange a house in Étretat for Monet's girlfriend Camille Doncieux and their newborn son, allowing Monet to paint in relative comfort, surrounded by his family.\\nBetween 1867 and 1893, Monet and fellow Impressionists Alfred Sisley and Camille Pissarro painted hundreds of landscapes illustrating the natural effect of snow (effet de neige).  Similar winter paintings of lesser quantity were produced by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, and Paul Gauguin.  Art historians believe that a series of severe winters in France contributed to an increase in the number of winter landscapes produced by Impressionists.The Magpie is one of approximately 140 snowscapes produced by Monet.  His first snowscape, A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur, was painted sometime in either 1865 or 1867, followed by a notable series of snowscapes in the same year, beginning with the The Road in Front of Saint-Simeon Farm in Winter.  The Magpie was completed in 1869 and is Monet's largest winter painting.  It was followed by The Red Cape (1869–1871), the only known winter painting featuring Camille Doncieux.The canvas of The Magpie depicts a solitary black magpie perched on a gate formed in a wattle fence, as the light of the sun shines upon freshly fallen snow creating blue shadows.  The painting features one of the first examples of Monet's use of colored shadows, which would later become associated with the Impressionist movement. Monet and the Impressionists used colored shadows to represent the actual, changing conditions of light and shadow as seen in nature, challenging the academic convention of painting shadows black. This subjective theory of color perception was introduced to the art world through the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Michel Eugène Chevreul earlier in the century.\\nAt the time, Monet's innovative use of light and color led to its rejection by the Paris Salon of 1869. Today, art historians classify The Magpie as one of Monet's best snowscape paintings. The painting was privately held until the Musée d'Orsay acquired it in 1984; it is considered one of the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.\\n\\n",

The painting is a key work in Manet's production, marking the beginning of a new period in his artistic career and generally in the history of modernism in French painting.  It is in National Museum of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires and it is considered as one of the collection's highlights.  Manet had special feelings for this painting, and La Nymphe surprise remained in the artist's possession his entire life, and there is evidence that points to the fact that, apart from the emotional significance it represented for the artist,  Manet considered this painting as one of his most important works.",

      "The Rue Mosnier with Flags is an 1878 oil on canvas painting by Édouard Manet, showing the eponymous Parisian street, decorated with French flags for the first national holiday on 30 June 1878, the Fête de la Paix (Celebration of Peace).  The Fête de la Paix was held during that year's Exposition Universelle, which together marked France's recovery after the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune.  The holiday was moved to 14 July in 1880 to become Bastille Day.  The painting is held by the J. Paul Getty Museum.The painting depicts a scene on the Rue Mosnier, now the Rue de Berne, which is overlooked by Manet's studio at 4 Rue de Saint-Pétersbourg .  It was painted from an upstairs window, with tricolour flags hanging from the buildings along the road, above passing pedestrians and carriages.  In the foreground is a man with a ladder, and a one-legged man on crutches, possibly a veteran wounded in the Franco-Prussian War.  Behind a fence to the left is rubble from building works to extend the Gare Saint-Lazare.   The painting measures 65.4 cm × 80 cm (25.7 in × 31.5 in) and it is signed and dated in the lower left corner, 'Manet / 1878'.  This work echoes the composition of another Manet painting of 1878, Road-menders in the Rue Mossnier.  Another 1878 Manet painting of a similar scene of the Rue Monsier, decorated with flags, is held in a private collection.\\nSimilar paintings of flags on the Rue Montorgueil and Rue Saint-Denis in Paris in 1878 were made by Claude Monet, and these works were echoed by a 1917 painting of New York by Childe Hassam, The Avenue in the Rain.\\nThe painting passed through the hands of Jean-Baptiste Faure in the 1890s, and then Auguste Pellerin until 1910.  It was owned by the Hungarians Marcell Nemes and then Baron Mór Lipót Herzog, and it was sold before 1932 to German banker Jakob Goldschmidt.  After his death in 1955, it was sold by his estate in London in 1958 to Paul Mellon, and then sold at Christie's in New York in 1989 to the J. Paul Getty Museum, in California.",

      "Women in the Garden (French: Femmes au jardin) is an oil painting begun in 1866 by French artist Claude Monet when he was 26. It is a large work painted en plein air; the size of the canvas necessitated Monet painting its upper half with the canvas lowered into a trench he had dug, so that he could maintain a single point of view for the entire work. The setting is the garden of a property he was renting. His companion Camille posed for the figures. Monet finished the work indoors, and used magazine illustrations to render fashionable clothing.\\nMonet at this time was early in his career, experimenting with method and subject matter. His earlier paintings were successful at Paris Salons, but Women in the Garden was rejected in 1867 on the grounds of subject and narrative weakness. The Salon was also troubled by Monet's heavy brushstrokes, a style which would, of course, become one of the hallmarks of Impressionism. A judge commented, 'Too many young people think of nothing but continuing in this abominable direction. It is high time to protect them and save art!'  The painting was purchased by fellow artist Frédéric Bazille to help support Monet at a time when he had no money.Although the Musée d'Orsay, the painting's owner, comments that 'Monet has skilfully rendered the white of the dresses, anchoring them firmly in the structure of the composition', Christoph Heinrich, author of a Monet biography, notes how posterity has found the painting lacking. In this view, the figures appear poorly integrated into the scene, with the woman at right 'gliding across the ground as if she had a trolley concealed beneath her dress'. The painting's treatment of light and shadow is lauded, however, and in this respect the work may have shown Monet where his artistic path lay.",

It is housed at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris and is one of Impressionism's most celebrated masterpieces. The painting depicts a typical Sunday afternoon at the original Moulin de la Galette in the district of Montmartre in Paris. In the late 19th century, working class Parisians would dress up and spend time there dancing, drinking, and eating galettes into the evening.Like other works of Renoir's early maturity, Bal du moulin de la Galette is a typically Impressionist snapshot of real life. It shows a richness of form, a fluidity of brush stroke, and a flickering, sun-dappled light.\\nFrom 1879 to 1894 the painting was in the collection of the French painter Gustave Caillebotte; when he died it became the property of the French Republic as payment for death duties. From 1896 to 1929 the painting hung in the Musée du Luxembourg in Paris. From 1929 it hung in the Musée du Louvre until it was transferred to the Musée d'Orsay in 1986.",
