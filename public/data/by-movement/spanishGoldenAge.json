    "abstract": "The Burial of the Count of Orgaz (Spanish: El Entierro del Conde de Orgaz) is a 1586 painting by El Greco, a prominent Renaissance painter, sculptor, and architect of Greek origin. Widely considered among his finest works, it illustrates a popular local legend of his time. An exceptionally large painting, it is divided into two sections, heavenly above and terrestrial below, but it gives little impression of duality, since the upper and lower sections are brought together compositionally.\\nThe painting has been lauded by art scholars, characterized, inter alia, as 'one of the most truthful pages in the history of Spain', as a masterpiece of Western Art and of late Mannerism, and as the epitome of Greco's artistic style.",
