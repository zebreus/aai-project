      "La Promenade is an oil on canvas, early Impressionist painting by the French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir, created in 1870.  The work depicts a young couple on an excursion outside of the city, walking on a path through a woodland. Influenced by the rococo revival style during the Second Empire, Renoir's  La Promenade reflects the older style and themes of eighteenth-century artists like Jean-Honor√© Fragonard and Jean-Antoine Watteau.  The work also shows the influence of Claude Monet on Renoir's new approach to painting.",
