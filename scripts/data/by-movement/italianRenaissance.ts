It seems to mark the start of Masolino and Masaccio's collaboration. \\nDismembered in the 17th century, it is now totally lost except for panel showing Julian (Diocesan Museum of Santo Stefano al Ponte in Florence) and one of the three panels of the predella. That predella panel was long thought to be the painting by Masolino now in the Ingres Museum in Montauban, but recent expert studies by the Opificio delle Pietre Dure have instead identified it as a painting by Masaccio in the Museo Horne in Florence.",

    abstract:
      "Assumption of the Virgin is a religious painting by Perugino, showing the Assumption of Mary, dating to 1506 and housed in the Seripandi side chapel of Naples Cathedral. It was restored between 2001 and April 2004. It uses much the same composition as the 1513 Corciano Altarpiece on the same theme.\\nIt is first documented in Lives of the Artists by Vasari, in which he writes '[Perugino] painted a high altarpiece for cardinal Carafa of Naples, an Assumption of the Virgin with the apostles gathered around the tomb'. The attribution and dating of the work has been heavily debated. Doubts were expressed by Cavalcaselle (1864), Venturi (1913) and Umberto Gnoli (1923), who all felt that the work was largely by his studio assistants. Bernard Berenson reconsidered the attribution to Perugino alone and in 1960 Molatoli re-ascribed the work mainly to the master's hand, with some collaboration from his assistants, possibly including Giovanni Battista Caporali.Vasari identified the commissioner as Oliviero Carafa, but in 1624 Cesare d’Engenio instead stated that the commissioner was Vincenzo Carafa. In 1959 Franco Strazzullo returned to Oliviero, showing that he was the kneeling figure portrayed beside the apostles by comparison with his depiction in Filippino Lippi's Annunciation in the Carafa chapel in Santa Maria Sopra Minerva, Raphael's Disputation of the Holy Sacrament and the statue of Oliviero in Naples Cathedral.",

      "The Isleworth Mona Lisa is an oil-on-canvas painting of the same subject as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. In 2015 and 2016, peer-reviewed academic publications concerning it confirmed its attribution to Leonardo da Vinci.In 1913 English connoisseur Hugh Blaker spotted and acquired the painting which had been hanging for over a century in a manor house in Somerset, having been bought in Italy as an original Leonardo. In a monograph published shortly thereafter, Blaker's stepfather, John R. Eyre, proposed that two versions of the Mona Lisa had been worked on by Leonardo; the 'Isleworth' picture (named after the location of Blaker's studio in Isleworth, west London) being the first.The painting was subsequently bought by Henry F. Pulitzer, who argued that it was Leonardo's only real portrait of Lisa Gherardini.. When Pulitzer died in 1979 his partner, Elizabeth Meyer, inherited the painting. When she died in 2008, the Isleworth Mona Lisa was sold to a private collection and is not currently on display to the public. Ownership of the painting is disputed as an anonymous 'distinguished European family' has claimed that the painting's former owner had sold a 25% in the painting, but a lawyer stated that the claim was clearly without merit. The Isleworth Mona Lisa has been examined by many experts in recent years, and been filmed for a TV documentary.",

It is considered by some art historians to be the Renaissance's first tondo - or circular work of art. The work is 56cm in diameter and features a nativity scence on the front and a young child playing with small dog on the back. \\nWhile the birth of Jesus, and that of his mother, were very common scenes in religious art, and often used contemporary settings and costumes,  actual depictions of a contemporary childbirth were very rare.",

It was his first depiction of Saint Sebastian, a subject to which he would frequently return. To the left is St Roch and to the right St Peter.\\nIt was originally dated and signed 'PETRUS PERUSINUS P[INXIT] / A[NNO DOMINI] MCCCCLVIII' (Peter of Perugia painted [this] / Year of Our Lord 1478). In 1478 he was back in Umbria after a period in Andrea del Verrocchio's studio in Florence. He began to receive important commissions, whose success was noted by pope Sixtus IV, who summoned him to Rome. That same year, the Confraternity of Mary Magdalene (confraternita della Maddalena) summoned him to Cerqueto, near Perugia, where he painted a cycle of frescoes - this is the only surviving fragment from the cycle.",

      "Battle of the Centaurs is a relief by Italian Renaissance artist Michelangelo, created around 1492. It was the last work Michelangelo created while under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici, who died shortly after its completion. Inspired by a classical relief created by Bertoldo di Giovanni, the marble sculpture depicts the mythic battle between the Lapiths and the Centaurs. A popular subject of art in ancient Greece, the story was suggested to Michelangelo by the classical scholar and poet Poliziano. The sculpture is exhibited in the Casa Buonarroti in Florence, Italy.\\nBattle of the Centaurs was a remarkable sculpture in several ways, presaging Michelangelo's future sculptural direction.  Michelangelo had departed from the then current practices of  working on a discrete plane to work multidimensionally. It was also the first sculpture Michelangelo created without the use of a bow drill and the first sculpture to reach such a state of completion with the marks of the subbia chisel left to stand as a final surface. Whether intentionally left unfinished or not, the work is significant in the tradition of 'non finito' sculpting technique for that reason. Michelangelo regarded it as the best of his early works, and a visual reminder of why he should have focused his efforts on sculpture.",

In addition to the main panel depicting the enthroned Virgin and Child surrounded by Angels and Saints, there were nine predella panels accompanying it, narrating the legend of the patron saints, Saints Cosmas and Damian.  Only the main panel actually remains  to be seen in the Convent of San Marco, Florence, Italy, today, along with two predella panels  depicting saints which were purchased back for the museum as recently as 2007. The San Marco Altarpiece is known as one of the best early Renaissance paintings for its employment of metaphor and perspective, trompe l'oeil, and the intertwining of Dominican religious themes and symbols with contemporary, political messages.",

'The proportions of the human body according to Vitruvius') is a drawing made by the Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci in about 1490. It is accompanied by notes based on the work of the Roman architect Vitruvius. The drawing, which is in ink on paper, depicts a man in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and inscribed in a circle and square. It is kept in the Gabinetto dei disegni e delle stampe of the Gallerie dell'Accademia, in Venice, Italy, under reference 228. Like most works on paper, it is displayed to the public only occasionally, so it is not part of the normal exhibition of the museum.The drawing represents ideal human body proportions. Its inscription in a square and a circle comes from a description by the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius in Book III of his treatise De architectura. Yet, as it has been demonstrated, Leonardo did not represent Vitruvius's proportions of the limbs but included those he found himself after measuring male models in Milan. While the drawing is named after Vitruvius, some scholars today question the appropriateness of such a title.",

    abstract:
      "Bacchus (1496–1497) is a marble sculpture by the Italian High Renaissance sculptor, painter, architect and poet Michelangelo. The statue is somewhat over life-size and depicts Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, in a reeling pose suggestive of drunkenness. Commissioned by Raffaele Riario, a high-ranking Cardinal and collector of antique sculpture, it was rejected by him and was bought instead by Jacopo Galli, Riario’s banker and a friend to Michelangelo. Along with the Pietà the Bacchus is one of only two surviving sculptures from the artist's first period in Rome.\\nBacchus is depicted with rolling eyes, his staggering body almost teetering off the rocky outcrop on which he stands. Sitting behind him is a faun, who eats the bunch of grapes slipping out of Bacchus's left hand.  With its swollen breast and abdomen, the Bacchus figure suggested to Giorgio Vasari 'both the slenderness of a young man and the fleshiness and roundness of a woman', and its androgynous quality has often been noted (although the testicles are swollen as well). The inspiration for the work appears to be the description in Pliny the Elder's Natural History of a lost bronze sculpture by Praxiteles, depicting 'Bacchus, Drunkenness and a satyr'. The sense of precariousness resulting from a high centre of gravity can be found in a number of later works by the artist, most notably the David and the figures on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.\\n\\nBacchus wears a wreath of ivy leaves, as that plant was sacred to the god. (They are not, as is often supposed, vine leaves.) In his right hand he holds a goblet of wine and in his left the skin of a tiger, an animal associated with the god 'for its love of the grape' (according to Michelangelo's biographer Ascanio Condivi). The hand holding the goblet was broken off and the penis chiseled away before Maarten van Heemskerck saw the sculpture in the 1530s.  Only the goblet was restored, in the early 1550s.  The mutilation may have been to give the sculpture an illusion of greater antiquity, placed as it initially was among an antique torso and fragmentary Roman reliefs in Jacopo Galli's Roman garden. Such a concession to 'classical' sensibilities did not, however, convince Percy Bysshe Shelley of the work's fidelity to 'the spirit and meaning of Bacchus'. He wrote that 'It looks drunken, brutal, and narrow-minded, and has an expression of dissoluteness the most revolting.' The art historian Johannes Wilde summarised responses to the sculpture thus: 'in brief... it is not the image of a god'.The statue was commissioned for the garden of Cardinal Raffaele Riario who intended for it to complement his collection of classical sculptures. It was rejected by Cardinal Riario and by 1506 found its way to the collection of Jacopo Galli, banker to both the cardinal and Michelangelo, who had a similar garden near the Palazzo della Cancelleria. There it first appeared in a drawing by Maarten van Heemskerck, c. 1533-36. The statue was bought for the Medici and transferred to Florence in 1572.",

      "The Corciano Altarpiece is a 1513 painting by Perugino now in the parish church of Santa Maria in Corciano.\\n It was produced following a past commission for Perugino to decorate the high altar of the parish church in Corciano. \\nIt shows the Assumption of Mary, with Mary herself in a contrapposto pose inside a double mandorla, surrounded symmetrically by seraphim, with two angels praying and two playing musical instruments. On the lower register are the eleven apostles, with only John the Evangelist kneeling. In the background are a clear sky and gilded treeless hills, forming a valley.\\nPerugino largely used and adapted his existing drawings for the work, reusing angels from the scene of the Baptism of Christ in the Sant'Agostino Altarpiece and arranging the apostles as in the Annunziata Polyptych. The work also has a two panel predella showing The Annunciation and The Adoration of the Christ Child.",

The painting's title, applied as early as the seventeenth century, identifying the sitter as the wife or daughter of an ironmonger (a ferronnier), was said to be discreetly alluding to a reputed  mistress of Francis I of France, married to a certain Le Ferron.  Later she was identified as Lucretia Crivelli, a married lady-in-waiting to Duchess Beatrice of Milan, who became another of the Duke's mistresses.Leonardo's Lady with an Ermine has also been known by this name. This was once believed to be a portrait of Cecilia Gallerani, one of the mistresses of Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan. The narrative and the title were applied to Lady with an Ermine when it was in Princess Czartoryski's collection, and became confused with La Belle Ferronniere by the presence in this image also of a jewel worn on a delicate chain across the forehead, called a ferronnière.",

On top of the altar is the Madonna and Child, a sculpture (probably) by Jacopo della Quercia. The central painting of the Madonna is by Paolo di Giovanni Fei and from the late 14th century.

      "The Marriage of the Virgin is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Perugino, although it is now sometimes attributed to his pupil Lo Spagna. It depicts the marriage between Joseph and Mary, and is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts of Caen, France. Initially commissioned to Pinturicchio for the recently completed cathedral of Perugia, Perugino took over the commission and finished the work around 1500–1504, probably after several periods of stasis.\\nA very similar composition was painted by unknown artists (sometimes attributed to Fiorenzo di Lorenzo, probable teacher of Perugino or Rocco  Zoppo, assistant of Perugino) for the church of San Girolamo in Spello in 1492. Which (if present scholarship is correct) is about ten years earlier than Perugino's and Raphael's treatments of the same subject. The composition of the earlier work does not utilize the elegant central perspective appearing in Perugino's and Raphael's more famous works. However, the figures in the foreground are very similar to both later paintings, including the unmistakable young man breaking the rod. \\nLater, in 1797, the picture was looted by Napoleon and was subsequently taken to Caen, Normandy. Attempts by the commune of Perugia, and the personal commitment of Antonio Canova, to retrieve the work failed.\\nThe wide perspective of the picture, with at its centre an octagonal edifice and the aligned composition of the figures on the sides, is strongly related to the Perugino's Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter at the Sistine Chapel. The painting prominently displays the Virgin's engagement ring, which was then kept at the cathedral as a holy relic.",

This church was one of the most notable in the city and housed the chapels of the Baglioni family and other notable families in the city. It was demolished in the 1540s to make way for the moat of the Rocca Paolina and the Servites moved to the church of Santa Maria Nuova with their large collection of artworks, including Transfiguration, which was moved into that church's Graziani chapel, where it stayed until moving to its present home in 1863.The upper register shows Christ standing on a cloud in a contrapposto pose within a double mandorla and a ring of seraphim. Beside him are Moses and Elijah, kneeling on the same cloud. In the lower register are the apostles John (kneeling), Peter and James (to the right). In the background is a landscape. The composition largely reworks existing drawings made by Perugino, with the two registers and the mandorla originally used in his now lost Assumption in the Sistine Chapel.

      "Salvator Mundi is a painting by Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci dated to c. 1500. Long thought to be a copy of a lost original veiled with overpainting, it was rediscovered, restored, and included in a major Leonardo exhibition at the National Gallery, London, in 2011–12. Although several leading scholars have considered it to be an original work by Leonardo, this attribution has been disputed by other specialists, some of whom posit that he only contributed certain elements.The painting depicts Jesus in Renaissance dress, making the sign of the cross with his right hand, while holding a transparent, non-refracting crystal orb in his left, signaling his role as Salvator Mundi (Latin for 'Savior of the World') and representing the 'celestial sphere' of the heavens. Around 20 other variations of the work are known, by students and followers of Leonardo. Preparatory chalk and ink drawings of the drapery by Leonardo are held in the British Royal Collection.\\nIt is one of fewer than 20 known works by Leonardo, and was the only one to remain in a private collection. It was sold at auction for $450.3 million on 15 November 2017 by Christie's in New York to Prince Badr bin Abdullah, setting a new record for most expensive painting ever sold at public auction. Prince Badr allegedly made the purchase on behalf of Abu Dhabi's Department of Culture and Tourism, but it has since been posited that he may have been a stand-in bidder for his close ally and Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. This follows late-2017 reports that the painting would be put on display at the Louvre Abu Dhabi and the unexplained cancellation of its scheduled September 2018 unveiling. The current location of the painting has been reported as unknown, but a June 2019 report stated that it was being stored on bin Salman's luxury yacht, pending completion of a cultural center in Al-`Ula and an October 2019 report indicated it may be in storage in Switzerland.",

It had allegedly been hidden there before the Second World War to prevent the occupying German army from removing it from the chapel. It is probably the first original work by Masaccio. It was commissioned by the Florentine family of Castellani for the Basilica of San Lorenzo, and was later moved to San Giovenale.It is dated at the bottom in modern humanist letters, the first work in Europe not inscribed in Gothic characters, which read, 'ANNO DOMINI MCCCCXXII A DI VENTITRE D'AP[RILE]' (April 23, 1422). The central panel shows the Madonna enthroned with two angels and the child Jesus eating some vine, as a symbol of the Eucharist. The halo of the Madonna bears the Shahada written backwards. The left panel depicts Saint Bartholomew and Saint Blaise, and the right panel depicts Saint Anthony and Saint Juvenal (Giovenale). The left and right panels show a marked influence of 14th century models, while the complex perspective of the centre panel would have been something new for its time. Also, the use of three-dimensional solidity makes the painting revolutionary for its time.",

The altarpiece's 28, 29 or 30 panels were split up during the Napoleonic suppression of religious houses - most of its panels are now in the Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria in Perugia. It is notable as the painter's last masterwork before he moved into his late phase producing more provincial commissions.\\nIt was commissioned by the monks of Sant'Agostino church in Perugia. The first phase included the artist's peak years and the crisis from 1508 onwards which distanced him from the major artistic centres of Italy. The second phase included the end of those crisis years and after 1520 his final years. The work is often used as a base-line for dating other works from his late period.\\nThe main panel shows the Baptism of Christ in the Jordan by John the Baptist, with the Holy Spirit descending in a gilded nimbus, angels assisting, saints around the scene and the heads of seraphim above. All the panels were held in a frame by Mattia da Reggio, making the altarpiece double-sided. They were placed in the frame as the artist completed them, working up from the predella at the base, the columns, the main panels, an entablature, a cymatium and finally the works flanking the central panel.\\n\\n",

It portrays the condottiero and lord of Rimini and Fano Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, and is housed in the Musée du Louvre of Paris.\\nThe portrait depicts the condottiero by profile and, according to some sources, was based on a medal executed in 1445 by Pisanello, or to one by Matteo de' Pasti from 1450. The picture itself is believed to be executed by Piero della Francesca during his sojourn in Rimini, during which he also painted the fresco with Sigismondo Pandolfo kneeling after St. Sigismund in the Tempio Malatestiano (Cathedral) of the city.\\nDespite the choice of the profile representation, typical of the portraits of eminent figures of the type, Piero della Francesca showed his attention for naturalist details in the fine execution of the texture and the hair of the committent. This is a proof of his good knowledge of Flemish masters such as Rogier van der Weyden.\\nAttribution is not certain and very late. Until 1889, it used to belong to the Russian Imperial Art Collection. Only as art piece of the d'Ancona collection in Milan in late 19th century, it was first attributed to Piero della Francesca by art-dealer Giovanni Morelli. From there it moved to Contini-Bonacossi collection, where Roberto Longhi reiterated the attrubiton before the family sold it to the Louvre. However, doubts were raised by Italian art critics and professors, some of whom believed it to be a neoclassical fake due to its uncanny resemblance with the painting of Tempio Malatestiano. Similarly, an Italian ministerial art commission refused to buy it in 1969 as part of the Contini-Bonacossi bequest due to the doubts surrounding its attribution. French art historians have, instead, always been unanimous on its attribution, especially after entering the Louvre collection.",

      "The Madonna and Child with St John and Angels (c. 1497), also known as The Manchester Madonna, is an unfinished painting attributed to Michelangelo in the National Gallery, London. It is one of three surviving panel paintings attributed to the artist and is dated to his first period in Rome. The painting's attribution to Michelangelo was in doubt for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, but now most scholars are in agreement. The work first came to public attention in the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester in 1857, hence the title the “Manchester Madonna”.Like other Renaissance paintings of the Madonna and Child which include John the Baptist, the subject arises from a non-Biblical tradition that Virgin Mary and the Child Jesus met  Christ's cousin St John the Baptist, on the Holy Family's Flight into Egypt. The Virgin is depicted with one breast bared, as if she has recently been suckling her infant son; this recalls the theme of the Virgin breastfeeding common in medieval painting. In her hands is a book (traditionally Isahia chapt. 53) which she attempts to hold away from her son, the contents of which probably foretell his future sacrifice and his taking over himself the evil of the world. She looks over her left shoulder onto a scroll being read by a pair of angels; this is likely to be the scroll reading Ecce Agnus Dei ('Behold the Lamb of God'), usually an attribute of John the Baptist. \\nThe figures are arranged as if in a frieze, revealing Michelangelo's sculptor's mindset. The frieze becomes more convex at its centre with the figures of Virgin and Child, as in the later Pitti Tondo. Another similarity to relief sculpture is in the plain background: rather than the landscapes more common for exterior settings, Michelangelo has simply painted an expanse of sky. He also eschewed the richly decorated throne typical of sacra conversazione altarpieces, and de-emphasised the angels' wings.\\nMany areas of the painting are in a preliminary state; the black of the Virgin's robe was meant to be overpainted with the rich blue pigment lapis lazuli, and the angels on the left are indicated only by the green underpaint used for flesh tones in a kind of non-finito.",

The painting exemplifies Raphael's development as an artist and the culmination of his career. Unusually for a depiction of the Transfiguration of Jesus in Christian art, the subject is combined with an additional episode from the Gospels in the lower part of the painting.\\nThe Transfiguration stands as an allegory of the transformative nature of representation.

      "Study of a Kneeling Nude Girl for The Entombment is a drawing of c. 1500–1501  by Michelangelo, now in the Louvre Museum.  It is in black chalk, with pen and ink and white highlighting, on pink prepared (coloured) paper, and measures 26.6 cm x 15.1 cm.  It is a figure study made in preparation for his painting The Entombment, and is Michelangelo's only surviving study that was probably drawn from a nude female model. It also may be the earliest extant European drawing of a nude female model.The figure in the drawing relates to a woman seated in the lower left foreground of the painting. Included in the study are narrative details such as the nails of the cross, held in her left hand, and the crown of thorns in her right. Although the drawing's attribution has been doubted, it is now accepted as authentic. The elaboration of the plaited hair suggests that the drawing was made from life using a young girl as the model. The drawing was made in three stages: first it was lightly laid down in black chalk, then gone over with pen and light bistre, and finally drawn over completely with a finer pen and darker ink. Lateral strokes were placed at the bottom to indicate the ground plane, and touches of white body color were added to details of the figure. Rare for a drawing by Michelangelo is the pink ground, in this case achieved by rubbing crushed red chalk onto the paper.Because the use of nude female models was controversial, relatively few such drawings were made before the 17th century, when academic life classes were established. Before that boys or young men, typically studio apprentices, were used as models for figures of both sexes, as is sometimes rather apparent. Exceptions from the Italian Renaissance include Raphael, who made nude drawings, apparently of his mistress, and Lorenzo Lotto, who recorded in his account book having used women of ill repute as life models. In Florence, Michelangelo and Raphael initiated the practice of making preparatory studies of the nude prior to painting the figure fully clothed, in order to better understand the underlying structure of the body.\\n\\n",

      "Apollo and Daphnis is a c.1483 mythological painting by Perugino. It was sold to the Louvre in Paris in 1883, where it still hangs and  in whose catalogue it is known as Apollo and Marsyas. By the 1880s it had become misattributed to Raphael.\\nIt one of the most notable works commissioned from the artist by Lorenzo de' Medici. In the background is a rural scene with a city or castle, a three-arch bridge, trees typical of Perugino, hills and a river. The two nude figures in the foreground allude to that in ancient Greek and Roman art - this and the other classical references demonstrate how the work is intended to be decoded by the humanist classical elite of Florence. The standing contrapposto figure is the god Apollo, carrying a baton in his left hand and with a bow and quiver behind him. His pose draws on that of Hermes in a sculpture of Hermes and Dionysius by Praxiteles, now best known from the copy Hermes and the Infant Dionysus rediscovered in the 19th century.\\nThe identity of the seated flute-playing figure on the left is debated - it may be Marsyas, but that character is usually depicted as a satyr and so it may instead by Daphnis, a young shepherd who died of love for Apollo. Daphnis is the Greek form of the name Laurus, possibly linking the work to Lorenzo de Medici. His pose draws on a sculpture of Hermes by Lysippus, best known from the Seated Hermes discovered in 1758.",

It shows the Adoration of the Magi, with an idealised view from Città della Pieve towards Lake Trasimene and Val di Chiana in the background. It is often compared to the Adoration of the Magi in the Sala delle Udienze del Collegio del Cambio in Perugia by Perugino and his studio, which includes areas argued by some art historians to have been painted by a young Raphael.\\nIt was commissioned from him that year by the 'Sindaco della Compagnia dei Disciplanti' - the date is shown by two letters sculpted along the same wall by the artist and uncovered during works to improve the wall's drainage in 1835. Perugino demanded 200 florins for the work but was willing 'as a fellow citizen' to be content with 100 in installments. After several interventions by the Sindaco, he reduced the price to 25 florins but in return demanded to be granted the 'dignity of a great Master'. The work was restored in 1984.\\n\\n",

It is considered one of Perugino's best works.  As in some other cases, Perugino reused the details of the delicate figures here in other works, drawing later complaints from Giorgio Vasari.The convent of Fuligno originally had housed Clarissan nuns since 1419. Later it became a convent for noble Florentine girls, and received the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici and the Lapaccini family. Pietro Perugino, who by 1493 had settled mainly in Florence started to paint there. The fresco was 'discovered' and open to the public in the 19th century. It was originally attributed to Raphael, who was a pupil of Perugino later, and whose early style is very similar to his, but it was eventually realized that it was a work by Perugino.",

Its importance relates to its revolutionary use of perspective and chiaroscuro. The Tribute Money suffered great damage in the centuries after its creation, until the chapel went through a thorough restoration in the 1980s.",

      "The Chigi Altarpiece is an altarpiece by Perugino, dating to around 1506-1507. It is named after its commissioner Agostino Chigi, a Sienese banker, for the Chigi family chapel in the church of Sant'Agostino in Siena, where it still hangs.Like most altarpieces by Perugino, it has two registers. The upper heavenly one shows Christ on the cross surrounded by a symmetrical arrangement of angels and cherubim. The lower earthly register shows eight lamenting saints connected to the commissioner, the church and the chapel - on the right are John the Baptist and Jerome, for example. The deep landscape backgrounds shows hills and a clear sky. The work originally also had a predella, which is now divided between the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Art Institute of Chicago.",

The figure of Mary is stylistically similar to works for which the artist's wife Chiara Fancelli modelled. Behind her on both sides are kneeling Capuchin monks and above are two symmetrical praying angels, drawn from the same cartoon used by Perugino for his San Francesco al Prato Resurrection, Madonna in Glory with Saints, Gonfalone della Giustizia and other works. The deep landscape background with a town in the distance is typical of the artist. He re-used the composition for the Tezi Altarpiece.",

It currently hangs in the National Gallery in London.\\nIt was either executed in around 1499–1500, at the end of the artist's first Milanese period, or around 1506–1508, when he was travelling back and forth between Florence and Milan.

It is his most notable work in Florence, forming part of the sacred conversation style. It was a commission from the Pucci family - Antonio Billi's account book reports Dionigi and Giovanna Pucci commissioning a work from 'Master Piero della Pieve a Chastello, a Perugian' on 20 November 1493 and paying 55 gold ducats on its completion on 20 April 1496.\\nThe central panel shows Mary Magdalene (to whom the monastery church was dedicated in 1257) in prayer at the foot of the cross. The left panel shows the Virgin Mary with Saint Bernard (a major leader in the reform of Benedictine monasticism that caused the formation of the Cistercian order) and the right one shows John the Apostle with Saint Benedict. The three tall trees behind St Bernard may symbolise the Holy Trinity. A fourth panel on the north wall (the others are on the east wall) shows Christ lowering himself from the cross to hold the hands of St Bernard.\\nThe work is also mentioned in 16th century sources, although it was forgotten after the monastery passed to Carmelite nuns in 1628. In 1867 the nuns moved out and the convent was abandoned, leading to the rediscovery of the fresco.\\n\\n",

In his left hand Christ holds a goldfinch, which is symbolic of his future Passion.\\nScholarly opinion is divided on the work's attribution, with some believing it to be the work of a pupil of Leonardo such as Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio or Marco d'Oggiono; the Hermitage Museum, however, considers the painting to be an autograph work by Leonardo. The painting takes its name from the House of Litta, a Milanese noble family in whose collection it was for much of the nineteenth century.",

It was formerly attributed to Michelangelo, but now it is mostly considered to have been completed by someone else, such as Niccolò Menghini or Gian Lorenzo Bernini. According to the Galleria dell'Accademia, the sculpture's 'attribution to the master is still somehow controversial'.This Pietà depicts three figures, one of them the body of Jesus Christ. The sculpture was originally in a room beside the Santa Rosalia church in Palestrina and was owned by the Barberini family. Some sources indicate it was made in 1556. The sculpture was acquired by the government in 1939. The attribution to Michelangelo was made in the first half of the 18th century. There is no earlier discussion of the work as there is for nearly all others attributed to the master.",

      "The Deposition (also called the Bandini Pietà or The Lamentation over the Dead Christ) is a marble sculpture by the Italian High Renaissance master Michelangelo. The sculpture, on which Michelangelo worked between 1547 and 1555, depicts four figures: the dead body of Jesus Christ, newly taken down from the Cross, Nicodemus (or possibly Joseph of Arimathea), Mary Magdalene and the Virgin Mary. The sculpture is housed in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo in Florence and is therefore also known as the Florentine Pietà.According to Vasari, Michelangelo made the Florence Pietà to decorate his tomb in Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. He later sold it however, prior to completion of the work after intentionally damaging Christ's left arm and leg and removing several components for reasons still under debate. Some experts believe it was because the marble was flawed and the sculpture could not be completed without the addition of a piece of marble from another block ('piecing').Vasari noted that Michelangelo began to work on the sculpture around the age of 72. Without commission, Michelangelo worked tirelessly into the night with just a single candle to illuminate his work. Vasari wrote that he began to work on this sculpture to amuse his mind and to keep his body healthy. After 8 years of working on it, Michelangelo would go on and attempt to destroy the work in a fit of frustration. This marked the end of Michelangelo's work on the sculptural group, which found itself in the hands of Francesco Bandini, who hired an apprentice sculptor, by the name of Tiberio Calcagni, to restore the work to its current composition. The left leg of Christ is missing. Since its inception, the sculpture has been plagued by ambiguities and never ending interpretations, with no straightforward answers available.\\nThe face of Nicodemus under the hood is considered to be a self-portrait of Michelangelo himself.",

It is now in the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas. It shows the common medieval subject, included in the Golden Legend and other sources, of Saint Anthony (AD 251 – 356) being assailed in the desert by demons, whose temptations he resisted; the Temptation of St Anthony (or 'Trial') is the more common name of the subject.  But this composition apparently shows a later episode where St Anthony, normally flown about the desert supported by angels, was ambushed in mid-air by devils.",

Several pieces from it were taken abroad during the 19th century, with St Sebastian being bought by the Louvre in 1896.\\nIt shows the saint in a contraposto pose drawn from the Doryphoros of Polykleitos, echoed in a later autograph copy now in São Paulo. The symmetrical composition draws on Perugino's earlier works - he first used the motif in St Sebastian between St Roch and St Peter, a fresco painted in Cerqueto near Perugia. He stands on a terrace beneath a monumental arch with grotesque-decorated pilasters and a balustrade. On the base of the platform is the Latin inscription 'SAGITTAE. TUAE.INFIXAE. SUNT. MICHI', drawn from Psalm 38:2 ('Thy arrows are fixed in me'). The deep landscape background is typical of the artist, with wooded hills and mountains.

    abstract:
      "The Annunciation (ca. 1440–1445) is an Early Renaissance fresco by Fra Angelico in the Convent of San Marco in Florence, Italy. When Cosimo de' Medici rebuilt the convent, he commissioned Fra Angelico to decorate the walls with intricate frescos. This included the altarpiece, the inside of the monk’s cells, the friar’s cloister, the chapter house, and inside the corridors; around fifty pieces in total. All of the paintings were done by Angelico himself or under his direct supervision. Out of all of the frescos at the convent, the Annunciation is the most well known in the art world.\\nThe Annunciation is not Fra Angelico’s first painting on that theme nor his only one in the convent. His works are scattered across the world in well-known museums and galleries including the Prado. He is credited as the inventor of this type of composition, where Gabriel visits Mary in an outdoor setting. A typical Gothic Annunciation painting contained the archangel Gabriel visiting the Virgin Mary indoors and with Mary enthroned. The figures would appear flat, static, and unrealistic. This painting in particular is supposed to have 'achieved heights of singular elegance.' The way it handles space and lighting is revolutionary because it is a transition out of the Gothic period and into the Renaissance. Previous versions had no spatial awareness. The figures seemed to float in the air, and lines did not end in a vanishing point. This caused them to be lopsided and disproportional.\\nThis particular version of the Annunciation is located at the top of the stairs on the first floor where the San Marco dormitories are located - on the north side. This is one of only three frescoes that Fra Angelico painted outside on the walls of the corridor instead of inside the cells. The staircase has undergone many renovations including modifications to the window which affects the amount of light entering the convent. This fresco was meant to be viewed under low light. When viewing the painting, there is an invisible light source that would have made additional light unnecessary to the monks viewing the painting. If visitors to the convent viewed the painting today, it would not look authentic. There are now lights illuminating it from many different angles. With its placement at the top of the stairs Fra Angelico sought to bring the scene into the convent and into the daily lives of the monks. A lighter painting at the time would have been used for decoration, while a darker one was meant for reflection and prayer.\\nThe frescos inside the cells at the convent of San Marco were done with reserve. 'They were intended for contemplation and meditation and a reflection on poverty. Gold leaf and azurite were reserved for Cosimo de' Medici in his private cell and for the frescos in public spaces in the corridors.' The gold leaf and azurite were extravagant materials and were a luxury only given to Cosimo because he was a wealthy patron. The friars were given paintings in their cells for the sole purpose of praying. Even with the gold and azurite, the Annunciation in the north dormitory would have still been relatively dull because of its location in a convent. In the Annunciation Gabriel is seen approaching Mary outdoors in the cloister. Overlooking the loggia, an open-sided room of a convent that faces the outside, it is supported by columns. Gabriel is seen clad in pink and gold with multi-coloured wings stooping down with his gaze fixed on Mary. He is seen with his arms bent at the elbow with his hands crossed over his chest gesturing to Mary. Mary is depicted as sweet and innocent, yet taken aback by Gabriel's arrival. Her innocence and virginity is represented by the 'Hortus Conclusus' seen through the fence and the window in the background. Mary is seated facing him in her typical blue indicating her royal status and her purity. Her arms are folded in the same manner as Gabriel but this gesture shows her acceptance, humility, and submission. The cloister is surrounded by columns from the Composite order. They are all supporting Roman arches. Together they all work to frame Gabriel and Mary and highlight the focal point of the piece. The centre column in the foreground separates the painting into two spaces putting Gabriel and Mary at opposite ends, separating them but at the same time keeping them together.\\nThis fresco was not intended just for aesthetic purposes. Running across the loggia at the bottom of the fresco there is an inscription that instructs the viewer: 'Virginis Intacte Cvm Veneris Ante Figvram Preterevndo Cave Ne Sileatvr Ave.' It means when you come before the image of the Ever-Virgin take care that you do not neglect to say an Ave. This was a daily reminder for the monks to pray.",

It was then sold to a certain 'Buzzi', who sold it as a work of Raphael to prince Alexander Mikhailovich Galitzin, the Imperial Russian ambassador to Rome. His nephew Mikhailovich Galitzin moved it to Moscow where, in 1865, it was exhibited at the Galitzin Museum of Western Art. It was sold again in 1886 with the rest of the Galitzin collection, this time to the Hermitage Museum. In April 1931 it was one of the artworks ceded by Stalin to Andrew Mellon, US Secretary of State. In 1937 the Mellon collection formed the core of the new National Gallery of Art.\\nThe central panel shows the Crucifixion of Christ with John the Apostle and the Virgin Mary. One side panel shows Jerome with his lion and the other shows Mary Magdalene in a contemplative pose identical to that of John.",

Leonardo da Vinci might have finished the Annunciation in his early twenties.The subject matter is drawn from Luke 1.26-39 and depicts the angel Gabriel, sent by God to announce to a virgin, Mary, that she would miraculously conceive and give birth to a son, to be named Jesus, and to be called 'the Son of God' whose reign would never end.  The subject was very popular for artworks and had been depicted many times in the art of Florence, including several examples by the Early Renaissance painter Fra Angelico. The details of its commission and its early history remain obscure.In 1867, following  Gustav Waagen methods, Baron Liphart identified this Annunciation, newly arrived in the Uffizi Gallery from a convent near Florence, as by the young Leonardo, still working in the studio of his master Verrocchio. The painting has since been attributed to different artists, including Leonardo and Verrocchio's contemporary Domenico Ghirlandaio.",

The painting was greatly restored and repainted, and Leonardo probably left the portrait unfinished but close to completion.\\nThe man is positioned in a three-quarter position and he is holding a partition sheet. The musician stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision. Compared to the detailed face of the musician, the red hat, his tunic and his hair seem to be painted by a completely other painter. Art historians have recognised the fine art of da Vinci in the young man's face, though the partition sheet and his hand may have been added onto the original work.\\nSiegfried Woldhek, a Dutch illustrator, has claimed that Portrait of a Musician is one of three self-portraits by Leonardo.",

      "The Rondanini Pietà is a marble sculpture that Michelangelo worked on from 1552 until the last days of his life, in 1564. Several sources indicate that there were actually three versions, with this one being the last. The name Rondanini refers to the fact that the sculpture stood for centuries in the courtyard at the Palazzo Rondanini in Rome. Certain sources point out that biographer Giorgio Vasari had referred to this Pietà in 1550, suggesting that the first version may already have been underway at that time. The work is now in the Museum of Rondanini Pietà of Sforza Castle in Milan. \\nThis final sculpture revisited the theme of the Virgin Mary mourning over the emaciated body of the dead Christ, which he had first explored in his Pietà of 1499. Like his late series of drawings of the Crucifixion and the sculpture of the Deposition of Christ intended for his own tomb, it was produced at a time when Michelangelo's sense of his own mortality was growing. had worked on the sculpture all day, just six days before his death.The Rondanini Pietà was begun before The Deposition of Christ was completed in 1555. In his dying days, Michelangelo hacked at the marble block until only the dismembered right arm of Christ survived from the sculpture as originally conceived. The elongated Virgin and Christ are a departure from the idealised figures that exemplified the sculptor's earlier style, and have been said to bear more of a resemblance to the attenuated figures of Gothic sculpture than those of the Renaissance. Some also suggest that the elongated figures are reminiscent of the style used in Mannerism.It has also been suggested that the sculpture should not be considered unfinished, but a work in a continuous process of being made visible by the viewer as he or she moves around to see it from multiple angles.South African visual artist Marlene Dumas based her 2012 painting Homage to Michelangelo on the Rondanini Pietà.",

      "The Virgin appearing to St. Bernard is a painting by the Italian artist Pietro Perugino, the main painter of the Umbrian school that was based in Perugia. The panel was executed as an altarpiece for the church of Santa Maria Maddalena dei Pazzi in Florence. It was later acquired in 1829/30 for King Ludwig I of Bavaria from the Capponi in Florence, and eventually made it to the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. The work has been called 'one of the high points of European painting in the late 15th century.'The painting shows St Bernard of Clairvaux, deep in his studies, being interrupted by a fully corporeal vision of the Virgin Mary, who appears to him in the clear light of day. Four saints surround them. There is a seemingly effortless, perfect symmetry about the composition, yet there is nothing static or artificial about it in any way. The position of the Virgin and St. Bernard's prie-dieu are both slightly off balance, but not enough to ruin the serene harmony of the picture. The faces of the various figures contribute to this quiet beauty, without showing much individualism or realism. Likewise, the colours are bright and radiant, without being flashy.",

      "Two Venetian Ladies is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Vittore Carpaccio.\\nThe painting, believed to be a quarter of the original work, was executed around 1490 and  shows two unknown Venetian ladies.  The top portion of the panel, called Hunting on the Lagoon is in the Getty Museum, and another matching panel is missing.  The painting was formerly  considered to show two courtesans. Modern art historians think them more likely members to be of the patrician Torella family, as suggested by their fine clothes and the pearl necklaces, but academic debate continues, as with other similar Venetian paintings of the period.  Several objects - the white kerchief, the pearls and the animals (the doves, Venus's bird) are symbols of chastity.  Note the chopines, or platform clogs, on the left. \\nAnother painted panel, now in the Getty Museum [1], was published in 1944, and it was later realized that this is part of the same work, fitting above this part: it portrays several boats in a lagoon, and would explain the meaning of the scene, as two women awaiting their husbands' return after an expedition hunting, or fishing with cormorants, in the Venetian lagoon.[2]  This discovery was verified by an in depth technical analysis, comparing the two fragmentary panels.  Another panel the same size as these two combined would have been on the left; probably the two were hinged together to make a diptych, or a folding door or shutter.  The Getty panel has an illusionistic letter rack painted on the back of the panel, which was presumably matched on this panel.  This appears to be the earliest small-scale trompe-l'œil painting since antiquity.",

The composition draws on the painter's assemblage of drawings, with the Madonna and Child similar to those in his 1497 Fano Altarpiece, the two symmetrical gilded angels to those in the San Francesco al Prato Resurrection, Madonna in Glory with Saints and Madonna della Consolazione, all dating to around 1501 like the Gonfalon.",

It is 2.32 metres tall by 1.65 m wide, and is made up of 26 sheets of paper.\\nThe composition shows the Virgin Mary, with the Christ child sitting between her legs.  An adult male figure to the right, probably St Joseph, is pushed away by Mary.  In front of him is the infant St John the Baptist.  The adult figure standing to Mary's left is unidentified, as are other figures only just visible in the background.  Michelangelo repeatedly changed the composition and its forms, as is apparent in the cartoon's alterations.  The composition was originally thought to be of the Three Kings, which may be the reason for the title, but is now understood as referring to Christ's siblings mentioned in the Gospels (explained by Saint Epiphanias—another possible source for the title—as Joseph's sons by a previous marriage, and hence Mary's stepsons, leaving their marriage unconsummated—hence her pushing Joseph away—and Mary forever a virgin).\\nMichelangelo's biographer Ascanio Condivi used this cartoon for an unfinished painting.  A 19th-century Scottish collector, John Malcolm of Poltalloch, bought it for only £11 0s 6d. and, on John's death in 1893, his son John Wingfield Malcolm gave it to the British Museum. Parliament voted £25,000 to purchase the rest of his collection for the museum two years later.  The cartoon is on display in Gallery 90 of the Museum.",

Michelangelo's interpretation of the Pietà is unprecedented in Italian sculpture.

      "The Last Judgment (Italian: Il Giudizio Universale) is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance painter Michelangelo covering the whole altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City. It is a depiction of the Second Coming of Christ and the final and eternal judgment by God of all humanity. The souls of humans rise and descend to their fates, as judged by Christ who is surrounded by prominent saints.  Altogether there are over 300 figures, with nearly all the males and angels originally shown as nudes; many were later partly covered up by painted draperies, of which some remain after recent cleaning and restoration. \\nThe work took over four years to complete between 1536 and 1541 (preparation of the altar wall began in 1535). Michelangelo began working on it twenty-five years after having finished the Sistine Chapel ceiling, and was nearly 67 at its completion.  Michelangelo originally accepted the commission from Pope Clement VII, but it was completed under Pope Paul III, whose stronger reforming views probably affected the final treatment.In the lower part of the fresco, Michelangelo followed tradition in showing the saved ascending at the left and the damned descending at the right. In the upper part, the inhabitants of Heaven are joined by the newly saved.  The fresco is more monochromatic than the ceiling frescoes and is dominated by the tones of flesh and sky. The cleaning and restoration of the fresco, however, revealed a greater chromatic range than previously apparent. Orange, green, yellow, and blue are scattered throughout, animating and unifying the complex scene.\\nThe reception of the painting was mixed from the start, with much praise but also criticism on both religious and artistic grounds.  Both the amount of nudity and the muscular style of the bodies has been one area of contention, and the overall composition another.",

      "The portrait of a man in red chalk (c. 1510) in the Biblioteca Reale, Turin is widely, though not universally, accepted as a self-portrait of Leonardo da Vinci. It is thought that Leonardo da Vinci drew this self-portrait at about the age of 60. The portrait has been extensively reproduced and has become an iconic representation of Leonardo as a polymath or 'Renaissance Man'. Despite this, some historians and scholars disagree as to the true identity of the sitter.",

      "The Madonna of the Carnation, also known as the Madonna with Vase, Madonna with Child or Virgin with Flower, is a Renaissance oil painting by Leonardo da Vinci created around 1478–1480.  It is permanently displayed at the Alte Pinakothek gallery in Munich, Germany.The central and centered motif is the young Virgin Mary seated with Baby Jesus on her lap. Depicted in precious clothes and jewellery, with her left hand Mary holds a carnation (red, suggesting blood and the Passion). The faces are put into light while all other objects are darker, e.g. the flower is covered by a shadow. The child is looking up and the mother looking down, with no eye contact. The setting of the portrait is a room with two windows on each side of the figures.\\nOriginally this painting was thought to have been created by Andrea del Verrocchio, but subsequent art historians agree that it is Leonardo's work, probably made during his apprenticeship to Verrocchio. The Virgin's hair, left hand, the drapery, and flowers are similar to elements of Leonardo's Annunciation.",

      "Madonna and Child with Flowers, otherwise known as the Benois Madonna, could be one of two Madonnas Leonardo da Vinci had commented on having started in October 1478. The other one could be Madonna of the Carnation from Munich.\\nIt is likely that the Benois Madonna was the first work painted by Leonardo independently from his master Verrocchio.  There are two of Leonardo's preliminary sketches for this piece in the British Museum, although the painting was probably overpainted by other hands. The preliminary sketches and the painting itself suggest that Leonardo was concentrating on the idea of sight. The child is thought to be guiding his mother's hands into his central vision.The composition of Madonna and Child with Flowers proved to be one of Leonardo's most popular. It was extensively copied by young painters, including Raphael, whose own version of Leonardo's design (the Madonna of the Pinks) was acquired in 2004 by the National Gallery, London.\\nFor centuries, Madonna and Child with Flowers was considered lost. In 1909, the architect Leon Benois sensationally exhibited it in Saint Petersburg as part of his father-in-law's collection. The painting had been apparently brought from Italy to Russia by the notable connoisseur Aleksey Korsakov in the 1790s. Upon Korsakov's death, it was sold by his son to the Astrakhan merchant Sapozhnikov for 1400 roubles and so passed by inheritance to the Benois family in 1880. After many a squabble regarding attribution, Leon Benois sold the painting to the Imperial Hermitage Museum in 1914. The purchase was made by Ernst Friedrich von Liphart who was the curator of paintings and had correctly identified the artist. (Ernst's father Karl was an expert on Leonardo.)Since 1914 the painting has been exhibited in the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.",
