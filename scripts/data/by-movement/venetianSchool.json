    "abstract": "The Death of Actaeon is a late work by the Italian Renaissance painter Titian, painted in oil on canvas from about 1559 to his death in 1576 and now in the National Gallery in London.  It is very probably one of the two paintings the artist stated he had started and hopes to finish (one of which he calls 'Actaeon mauled by hounds') in a letter to their commissioner Philip II of Spain during June 1559.  However, most of Titian's work on this painting possibly dates to the late 1560s, but with touches from the 1570s. Titian seems never to have resolved it to his satisfaction, and the painting apparently remained in his studio until his death in 1576.  There has been considerable debate as to whether it is finished or not, as with other very late Titians, such as the Flaying of Marsyas, which unlike this has a signature, perhaps an indication of completion.\\n\\nIt is a sequel of Titian's work Diana and Actaeon showing the story's tragic conclusion, which approximately follows the Roman poet Ovid's account in the Metamorphoses: after Actaeon surprised the goddess Diana bathing naked in the woods, she transformed him into a stag and he was attacked and killed by his own hounds.Both paintings belong to a group of large-scale mythological paintings inspired by the Metamorphoses and referred to by Titian himself as ‘poesie’, the visual equivalent of poetry, which he began producing for Philip II of Spain in 1551 and which also include Danaë (many versions, Philip's in the Prado, Madrid), Venus and Adonis (private collection, London, but also other versions), Perseus and Andromeda (Wallace Collection, London), The Rape of Europa (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston), Diana and Actaeon and Diana and Callisto (shared by National Gallery of Scotland with NG London).  However, as The Death of Actaeon was never delivered to Philip, it is not always counted in the series.",

Judged to be worth about £5m in 2002, the two foot wide panel had been stolen from the first floor state drawing room in 1995 and was recovered 'in a plastic shopping bag' in August 2002.The painting has a provenance that goes back to the collection of the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, where it was catalogued in the 1660s by his court painter David Teniers the Younger. It was purchased from Christie's by the 4th Marquess of Bath in 1878 and had been at Longleat until the theft.As with most of the Teniers miniatures for the Archduke, it is unclear whether the engraving was made after the miniature or after this painting, but in any case the current literature points to this painting as the original source for both works. It can be seen hanging to the right of the doorway in one of Teniers' reproductions of the Archduke's gallery.",

    "abstract": "The Crowning with Thorns is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Titian (Tiziano Vecellio) done during 1542 and 1543. It is housed in the Musée du Louvre in Paris, France.\\nThe painting was commissioned by the confraternity of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. It was brought to France after the Napoleonic conquest of the city in 1797.\\nIn The Crowning with Thorns, painted for the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, the space is compressed in the scene by arranging the figures on a shallow plane delimited by the wall of a building. There are explicit references to antiquity: the figure of Christ derives from the celebrated Laocoon, an antique statue discovered in Rome in 1506, an archetypal exemplum doloris ('example of pain'). Another famous antique sculptural fragment, the Belvedere Torso, provides the model for the upper body of the torturer on the left. With the inclusion of the bust of Tiberius Caesar, a direct reference to the Roman authorities who condemned Christ, Titian also pays homage to the classical past.\\nThis is a brutal scene, in which Christ's tormentors twist the crown onto his head with their canes, but the violence is relieved and Christ's suffering exalted by the beauty of the colours, which especially in the blue and green to the right are colder than usual in deference to Titian's Roman sources. In Christ's foot extended on the steps, however, Titian pulls out all the Venetian stops and one can sense the blood flowing through the veins under the flesh. The pattern of the canes slices through the massed figures like the strokes of a knife, forming a Trinitarian triangle to the right of Christ's head. An inimitable Titian touch is the cane lying unused on the foremost step, still, shadowless and deadly, like a snake.According to Robert Haven Schauffler, the German painter Fritz von Uhde once considered it to be 'the greatest picture ever painted.'",

    "abstract": "The Portrait of Alfonso I d'Este is a now-lost painting by Titian, dating to 1523. It was painted as a pendant to the Portrait of Laura Dianti of the same year (Laura Dianti was Alfonso I d'Este's lover) and is now known through copies, one of which is by Rubens and another of which is held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Others are held in the collections of the countess of Vogüe Commarin at Dijon and the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen - the latter is the oldest but only shows the head and shoulders.\\nThe painting showed its subject with his right hand on the muzzle of a cannon and his left hand on the hilt of his sword, underlining his martial prowess during a tense time in his relations with the papacy. It was an influence on Dosso Dossi's later portrait of the duke in a similar pose, leaning on a cannon.\\nThe original was seen by Vasari and admired by Michelangelo on the latter's visit to Ferrara in 1529. It was later given to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who kept it for a time in Bologna before taking it to Spain. It is mentioned in the 1666 and 1686 inventories of the Royal Alcazar of Madrid, but disappeared during the 18th century.",

Its secondary title refers to Judith from the Apochrypha.\\nIt was originally on the facade of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, rebuilt in 1508 after the previous building was destroyed by fire. 1508 documents attest to a dispute over payment to Giorgione - these documents also show that the external frescoes had not yet been completed at that point. They were painted by Castelfranco and his young pupil Titian. The frescoes were to represent symbols of Venice's autonomy, since they were painted at a time of conflict between the Republic and Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. \\nVasari saw the frescoes less than a century after their completion - he did not understand their meaning but praised their proportions and 'most lively' colouring, which made them seem 'alive and not imitations'. Justice was originally over the southern doorway, leading to a narrow alleyway. Dolce records an episode in 1557, when it was mistaken for a work by Giorgione. Damaged by the humid and brackish climate of the lagoon, the frescoes were taken off the walls and moved indoors into the Galleria Giorgio Franchetti alla Ca' d'Oro and the Galleria dell'Accademia.",

Alfonso d'Avalos, Marquise del Vasto, was a noble Neapolitan, descended from a family of Castilian origin. He participated in the Battle of Pavia and the conquest of Tunis in 1535. In 1538 he was appointed governor of Milan. Military failures caused a subsequent falling out of favor with the Emperor Charles V.This work is both a portrait of the Marquis del Vasto and a picture of history narrating an incident that occurred in 1537. The Spanish troops stationed in Milan began an attempted mutiny over not receiving their pay, but the conflict was suppressed by the Marquis' eloquent speech to the men that inspired loyalty and guaranteed their pay given patience. He, having to leave for affairs elsewhere, left his son with the troops as a guarantee they would be paid.The marquis contracted Titian to paint the scene, depicting his son as a page holding his helmet for him during the speech. The composition is based on classical models, such as the reliefs of the Arch of Constantine and numerous Numismatic works. Titian features the General in an elevated position, addressing his men, and emphasizing his words, as advised classical oratory manuals, with elevation of the right arm.The work was commissioned in 1539 by the Marquis himself, during a trip to Venice. His first public exhibition was in Milan during 1541, taking advantage of the visit of Emperor Charles. It was subsequently acquired by the Gonzaga family, the Dukes of Mantua, and finally by King Charles I of England. When this King was executed his assets were auctioned, and the painting (like others of the same king) was acquired by Philip IV of Spain. In 1828 Fernando VII ceded it to the collection to the Museo del Prado.",

    "description": "painting by Titian",
    "abstract": "The Allegory of Prudence (c. 1550–1565) is an oil-on-canvas painting attributed to the Italian artist Titian and his assistants. The painting portrays three human heads, each facing in a different direction, above three animal heads (from left to right, a wolf, a lion and a dog). It is in the National Gallery, London.The painting is usually interpreted as operating on a number of levels. At the first level, the different ages of the three human heads represent the three ages of man (from left to right: old age, maturity and youth), a subject that Titian had depicted 50 years earlier in his The Three Ages of Man. The different directions in which they are facing reflect a second, wider concept of time itself as having a past, present and future. This theme is repeated in the animal heads: an animal with three heads (wolf, lion, dog) to represent the passage of time (past, present, future) is associated with Serapis in Macrobius's Saturnalia, and associated with Apollo by Petrarch, and the iconography is repeated for example in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili of Francesco Colonna (1499), the Hieroglyphica of  Pierio Valeriano (1556), and the Iconologia of Cesare Ripa (1643).  The third level, from which the painting has acquired its present name, is suggested by a barely visible inscription above the portraits: EX PRÆTE/RITO // PRÆSENS PRVDEN/TER AGIT // NI FVTVRA / ACTIONĒ DE/TVRPET (Latin for 'from the experience of the past, the present acts prudently, lest it spoil future actions'.)\\nIt has been argued that the human faces are actual portraits of the aged Titian, his son Orazio, and his young nephew, Marco Vecellio, who, like Orazio, lived and worked with Titian. Erwin Panofsky, in his classic exposition, suggests that the painting is specifically associated with the negotiations associated with the passing on of Titian's property to the younger generations, in the light of his approaching death. The painting therefore acts as a visual counsel to the three generations to act prudently in the administration of the inheritance. Nicholas Penny is, however, highly sceptical of this, and points out discrepancies between the human heads and other evidence of the individuals' appearance. He doubts it was a personal project of any sort and feels that is 'surely more likely that the painting was commissioned'.More recently the painting has been explained in quite different ways. Instead of an allegory of prudence, it has been seen as an allegory about sin and penitence. On this view, it amounts to an admission by Titian that his failure to act prudently in his youth and middle age has condemned him to lead a regretful old age.At the other extreme, the painting has been explained as asserting that the prudence which comes with experience and old age is an essential aspect of artistic discrimination and judgement. On this interpretation, the painting therefore acts as a rebuttal of the view that old age is the enemy of artistic achievement. On a more general level, the painting's depiction of Titian with his assistants Orazio and Marco is also intended as a defence of the prudence of the continuity of the Venetian workshop tradition.The painting was presented to the National Gallery in 1966 by the art dealer David Koetser and his wife Betty.",

The 90 cm high by 151 cm wide Renaissance art work was most likely influenced by Giorgione’s themes and motifs of landscapes and nude figures—Titian was known to have completed some of Giorgione’s unfinished works after Giorgione died at age 33 of the plague in 1510. The painting represents the artist’s conception of the life cycle. Childhood and manhood are synonymous with earthly love and death approaching old age are drawn realistically. Titian’s widely chosen topic in art history, ages of man, mixed with his own allegorical interpretation make The Three Ages of Man is one of Titian’s most famous works.",

It perhaps depicts a figure representing the bride dressed in white, sitting beside Cupid and accompanied by the goddess Venus.The title of the painting is first recorded in 1693, when it was listed in an inventory as Amor Divino e Amor Profano (Divine love and Profane love), and may not represent the original concept at all.Although 'much ink has been spilt by art historians attempting to decipher the iconography of the painting', and some measure of consensus has been achieved, basic aspects of the intended meaning of the painting, including the identity of the central figures, remain disputed.",

Diana is furious, and will turn Actaeon into a stag, who is then pursued and killed by his own hounds, a scene Titian later painted in his The Death of Actaeon (National Gallery).  \\nDiana is the woman on the right side of the painting. She is wearing a crown with a crescent moon on it and is being covered by the dark skinned woman who may be her servant.  The nymphs display a variety of reactions, and a variety of nude poses.\\nIn 2008–2009, the National Gallery, London and National Galleries of Scotland successfully campaigned to acquire the painting from the Bridgewater Collection for £50 million.

It includes the brothers Andrea and Gabriele Vendramin, and Andrea's seven sons. However Andrea was apparently only three years older than Gabriele, which one would not think from the two figures here. It remains uncertain which is which. The three young boys kneeling on the left were added later by another artist, and are markedly lower in quality.\\nThe figures are next an altar holding a reliquary of the True Cross, which still exists.  This was connected with a miracle in 1370-82 depicted by Vittorio Carpaccio, Gentile Bellini and other artists - when accidentally dropped into a canal during a congested procession it did not sink but hovered over the water, evading others trying to help, until an earlier Andrea Vendramin dived in and retrieved it.  This Andrea had been presented with the relic in 1369, in his capacity as head of the confraternity or Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista; they still hold the relc and its reliquary.   Both the large Bellini painting, The Miracle of the True Cross near San Lorenzo Bridge, of 1496-1500,[1], and the Carpaccio of 1494, are now in the Accademia museum in Venice.\\nTitian's painting has been described as, 'one of the greatest group portraits in history'. It balances youth and wisdom as well as demonstrating the power of this family and their public commitments to the Republic. The relic is a central part of the portrait and was seen as both a symbol of the Serene Republic, and a personal symbol for the Vendramin family. \\nThe painting was clearly designed for a specific location, presumably in one of the various Vendramin palaces in Venice, perhaps on a stairway. The lighting and very low vanishing point suggest that the primary viewing point was anticipated to be at the left of the canvas, with the lower edge at about head height.",

    "abstract": "A Man with a Quilted Sleeve is a painting of about 1510 by the Venetian painter Titian in the National Gallery, London, measuring 81.2 by 66.3 centimetres (32.0 in × 26.1 in).  Though the quality of the painting has always been praised, there has been much discussion as to the identity of the sitter.  It was long thought to be a portrait of Ariosto, then a self-portrait, but in 2017 is called Portrait of Gerolamo (?) Barbarigo by the gallery, having also been called merely Portrait of a Man, the title used here, The Man with the Blue Sleeve, and no doubt other variants.\\nPlacing a parapet, a low wood or stone sill or ledge, between the subject and the viewer is a common feature of early Renaissance Italian portraits, as a useful way of solving 'the principal compositional problem' of portraits at less than full-length, how 'to justify the cutting of the figure'. By having the large sleeve project slightly beyond the parapet, Titian 'subverts' the usual barrier effect, bringing the picture space into 'our space' as viewers.  The turning pose, with the head slightly atilt and an eyebrow appearing raised, exactly halfway across the composition, adds life and drama.  The 'broad spiral motion in depth of the head and arm' suggests that Titian had some awareness of contemporary developments in painting in Florence.  The sleeve is brilliantly painted, and the 'merging of the shadowed portions of the figure with the grey atmospheric background ... is one of the most innovative and influential aspects of the painting'.The painting comes from a crucial period in the development of the Italian Renaissance portrait, which was then being led by Venice.  According to John Steer, Titian retains the 'mood of generalized inner mystery' that Giorgione had brought to his portraits (which may not represent individuals who commissioned the painting) but shows the personality and 'physical assurance' of his sitter with new force and realism.  To some extent the 'ardent gaze' of this and other figures is adopted from paintings of religious subjects.The pose was borrowed in two self-portraits by Rembrandt, who saw the painting (or a copy) in Amsterdam.  Soon after it apparently moved to England via France.  It entered the National Gallery in 1904 as NG1944, and in 2017 was on display in Room 2.\\n\\n",

This can be seen in the expressive postures of the figures and the muted, yet intense color of the sea and sky.\\nTintoretto had a mostly Venetian audience and was known for painting scenes of Venice, but this painting departs from this path. Additionally, the scene was made to look overly dramatic rather than realistic. The paint is thin and Tintoretto uses extreme highlights, intensifying the darkness and light that seems to come from a compressed and directed light source.The painting is currently on display in the Samuel H.

Both share a   somber and reserved pallet, although this example is richer in tonal variation and colour harmonisation.It is unfinished, with his left hand, areas of his clothing only sketched and only roughly sketched. It has been suggested that the canvas is a modello, or study, for another now lost work. Another theory is that it was painted for family members for his memory after he died.\\nThematically and stylistically, the work can be associated with his 1545 Portrait of Pietro Aretino.

Titian recorded all of the foreground elements—the horse, its caparison, and the rider's armour—from those used in the actual battle. Both the armour and harness survive, and are kept at the Royal Armoury in Madrid. It was acquired by the Museo del Prado in 1827.",

It is signed, and considered to have been finished entirely by Titian himself. It is one of a series of great works from Titian's last years, but unlike some of these, is fully finished. It is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England.The story from early Roman history (or legend) of the rape of Lucretia by Sextus Tarquinius (Tarquin), and her subsequent suicide, was a popular subject in Renaissance art. Tarquin raped Lucretia after threatening to kill her if she rejected his advances; this is the moment shown here. The next day she exposed him and committed suicide, prompting the Romans to revolt and overthrow Tarquin's father Tarquin the Proud, the last king of Rome, and establish the Roman Republic. This is traditionally dated to 509 BC.  Violent subjects are characteristic of Titian's last years, mostly drawn from mythology or religion, but the directness of this composition stands out among them.The refinement of the poses of the figures is reflected in other contemporary versions of the painting. By this late stage in his career, Titian often took many years over paintings, setting them aside for long periods, only returning to them later. This painting is fully finished, and had been in progress for several years. As one of the latest documented and fully finished paintings by Titian, it is evidence for the much-debated question of whether other late Titians were ever finished or not.",

    "abstract": "Portrait of Isabella d'Este (or Isabella in Black) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Italian painter Titian, completed between 1534 and 1536. It shows the Marquess of Mantua,  Isabella d'Este, daughter of  Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, and Eleanor of Naples with an ermine zibellino draped over her shoulder. \\nAlthough Titian depicts her as a young woman, she was around 62 at the time  Isabella was socially ambitious and aware of the effect a painting by a renowned artists might have on her reputation and prestige - she also commissioned portraits by Leonardo da Vinci and Andrea Mantegna.It is one of two portraits Titian painted of her; Isabella in Red (or Aged Isabella) of 1529 is known only through a Peter Paul Rubens copy. It showed a more aged and matronly Isabella, but she was so displeased with the picture that she asked for a second idealised portrait, showing how she thought she looked forty years earlier. Art historian Lionel Cust mentions that Isabella's fame and renown was not due to 'beauty, but to intellect and character'. Fred Kleiner wrote that the work is a 'distinctive portrayal of his poised and self-assured patron that owes little to its model'. It is today in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.",

It remains in the position it was designed for, on the high altar of the Basilica di Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari or Frari church in Venice.  It is the largest altarpiece in the city, with the figures well over life-size, necessitated by the large church, with a considerable distance between the altar and the congregation.\\nIt marked a new direction in Titian's style, that reflected his awareness of the developments in High Renaissance painting further south, in Florence and Rome,  by artists including Raphael and Michelangelo.  The agitated figures of the Apostles marked a break with the usual meditative stillness of saints in Venetian painting, in the tradition of Giovanni Bellini and others.It was perhaps originally rather shocking for the Venetian public, but soon recognised as a masterpiece that confirmed Titian's position as the leading artist in Venice, and one of the most important in all Italy, a rival to Michelangelo and Raphael.",

    "abstract": "Lucretia and her Husband Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus or Tarquin and Lucretia is an oil painting attributed to Titian, dated to around 1515 and now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The attribution to this artist is traditional but uncertain - the brightened palette suggests it could instead be by Palma Vecchio. However, others identify the painting as part of Titian's series of half-length female figures from 1514 to 1515, which also includes the Flora at the Uffizi, the Woman with a Mirror at the Louvre, the Violante and the Young woman in a black dress in Vienna, Vanity in Munich and the Salome at the Galleria Doria Pamphilj.  There is an early copy in the Royal Collection.Lucretia poised with a dagger, about to commit suicide, was becoming a very common subject in art. However, the addition of a male figure just behind her is all but unique. The Kunsthistorisches Museum now calls this figure Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, Lucretia's husband, but the Royal Collection identifies him as her rapist, Sextus Tarquinius (known as Tarquin), as do most sources. Her husband was present at her death, according to most of the differing Roman accounts of the story, and Tarquin was not. If the figure is intended to be Tarquin, the setting must be the night before, with Lucretia perhaps making her plan.\\nThe painting depicts Lucretia about to commit suicide to preserve her honour after disclosing her rape by Sextus Tarquinius the previous night, making her the model of Roman female virtus. Her face looks up to the divine illumination coming from above, giving her the strength to commit the act. As in other treatments of the subject, there are sensual elements, such as Lucretia's falling robe and almost-bared breast. The robe's green is particularly bright, witnessing to the high quality of pigments available in Venice.\\nThe painting can be seen as one of a number of Venetian paintings of the 1510s showing two or three half-length figures with heads close together, often with their expressions and interactions enigmatic. Most of these are 'Giorgionesque' genre or tronie subjects where the subjects are anonymous.  \\nThe painting in Vienna, or the other version still in the Royal Collection, may be the painting mentioned by Ridolfi in 1648 as being in the gallery of Charles I of England, whose Italian paintings mainly came from his purchase of the Gonzaga collection in Mantua. The Vienna version might have passed to the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria.  \\nTitian's better known late depiction of Lucretia's rape by Tarquin was completed over 50 years later, in 1571 (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge).",

It is usually dated to around 1515 and is now in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery in Rome.  Like other paintings of this subject, it has sometimes been considered to represent Judith with the Head of Holofernes, the other biblical incident found in art showing a female and a severed male head .  Historically, the main figure has also been called Herodias, the mother of Salome.\\nSometimes attributed to Giorgione, the painting is now usually seen as one where Titian's personal style can be seen in development, with a 'sense of physical proximity and involvement of the viewer', in which 'expert handling of the malleable oil medium enabled the artist to evoke the sensation of softly spun hair upon creamy flesh'.Erwin Panofsky suggested the head of John the Baptist might be a self-portrait, and it is possible that Titian was alluding to his private life with the model, anticipating Cristofano Allori's, Judith with the Head of Holofernes (1613, Royal Collection, and other versions), where the severed head was a self-portrait and Judith and the maid portraits of his ex-mistress and her mother.  The model here, allowing for a degree of idealization, has been said to be the same used in the Dresden Venus (Giorgione and Titian, c. 1510).This composition was copied many times, in some cases at least by Titian's workshop.\\n\\n",

It is a painting made for display in a home rather than a church.It is close to compositions by Titian's former master Giovanni Bellini, especially, when reversed, one of 1509 in the Detroit Institute of Arts, and has been seen as a challenge to the much older master, by taking on a characteristic compositional formula of his.  The style is much indebted to Giorgione, and it was often attributed to him in the earlier 20th century.  This is especially so in the 'harmonious fullness and slow gravity of form' of the figure of the Virgin, which uses a type of figure Titian did not repeat in later Madonnas.  The landscape is virtually identical to the left-most section of the background of the Dresden Venus, traditionally thought to have been begun by Giorgione, but with the landscape done after his death in 1510 by Titian.The right background is occupied with a cloth of honour, painted with careful attention to its folds (they were often stored folded up).  These were hung behind thrones, as in very many paintings of enthroned Madonnas, and here it implies that an unoccupied throne is out of sight to the right.  The Bellini in Detroit uses the same device.  The composition is therefore a half-way stage between the older more formal enthroned Madonnas and newer compositions with the Virgin and Child shown informally in a landscape setting.  Madonnas by Bellini and his followers had for some time been showing small glimpses of landscape to the sides of the painting, usually cut off by a parapet lower down, and the formula here, using a horizontal 'landscape' format, develops this.",

It was exhibited in the Tribuna in 1677 and attributed to Giorgione in 1709, as shown on a label on the back of the painting. It was then moved to the villa di Poggio a Caiano. After several subsequent moves, in 1798 it finally arrived back Uffizi.\\nOxidisation in the paint in the 19th century made attribution difficult. Joseph Archer Crowe, Cavalcaselle and Giovanni Morelli could not decide on the work's artist, Otto Mündler (1869) argued it was by Pietro della Vecchia and Roberto Longhi that it was by Paris Bordone - other critics shifted between Giorgione and Titian as the artist.

It is now in the Archbishop's Palace in Kroměříž, Czech Republic and belongs to the Archbishopric of Olomouc (administered by Olomouc Museum of Art – Archdiocesan Museum). It is one of Titian's last works, and may be unfinished, although there is a partial signature on the stone in the foreground.The painting shows the killing by flaying or skinning alive of Marsyas, a satyr who rashly challenged the god Apollo to a musical contest.  It is one of several canvases with mythological subjects from Ovid which Titian executed in his late years, mostly the poesie series for King Philip II of Spain, of which this painting seems not to have been part. \\nThe painting has been in Kroměříž in Moravia since 1673, and was rather forgotten about, being off the beaten track as far as Venetian painting is concerned.  It  'did not enter critical literature until 1909'.  By the 1930s it was 'widely accepted as an important late work' among scholars, but little known by a wider public.  \\nOn its first modern appearance abroad, it 'was greeted with astonished admiration' as the 'star attraction' of a major exhibition at the Royal Academy in London in 1983, It was new to most viewers and was described by John Russell in the New York Times as 'the most astonishing picture in the show'.  Beginning an extended analysis, Sir Lawrence Gowing wrote that 'All these months – it is not too much to say – London has been half under the spell of this masterpiece, in which the tragic sense that overtook Titian’s poesie in his seventies reached its cruel and solemn extreme. At most hours on most days there is a knot of visitors riveted and fairly perplexed in front of it. ... At the Academy people still ask, and on the radio well-meaning critics debate, how it is possible that a horribly painful subject should be the occasion of beauty or greatness in art.'",

The decorative programme included other major paintings celebrating Bacchus and Venus, the gods of wine and love. Like its predecessor Bacchus and Ariadne, The Bacchanal of the Andrians was inspired by the Imagines of Philostratus.\\nThe painting is set on the island of Andros. A sleeping nymph and a urinating boy are seen in the lower right foreground while men and women celebrate with jugs of wine. The absence of Bacchus from the painting is explained by Erwin Panofsky, who suggests that the god must be on the departing ship seen in the center background. Due to the artistic liberties Titian took in painting these figures, it is difficult to identify them. The musical score in the foreground is the canon Chi boyt et ne reboyt il ne seet que boyre soit ('who drinks and does not drink again does not know what drinking is'), attributed to Ferrarese court musician Adrian Willaert.The Bacchanal of the Andrians has been admired by other artists including Rubens who copied it in versions that are housed at the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm.",

It describes a Roman rite of worship conducted in honour of the goddess Venus each 1 April. On this occasion, women would make offerings to representations of the goddess so as to  cleanse 'every blemish on their bodies'.In Titian's work, two nymphs, one young and one matronly, are situated to the right of the ceremony, attending to a shrine holding a representation of Venus. The shrine is surrounded by votive tablets. The older woman checks on the decorations with the use of a mirror which she holds high in her extended right hand. The foreground of the canvas is thronged with a swarm of male infants, or putti, who distract themselves in activities such as climbing trees, leaping, flying, gathering apples, lying around, fighting, fondling, shooting arrows and pulling each other's hair. A dam is shown in the middle background, near a sunlit meadow. The far distance is decorated with a mountain and blue sky.\\nTitian based the image on the writings of the Greek sophist Philostratus. In his 'Imagines I, VI', Philostratus wrote, 'See cupids are gathering apples: and if there are many of them, do not be surprised...The cupids' quiver are studded with gold, and golden also are the darts in them...they have hung their quivers on the apple trees; and in the grass lie their broidered mantles...Ah, the baskets into which they gather their apples!'",

    "abstract": "The Pietà now in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice is one of the last paintings by the Italian master Titian, and in its final, extended, state was left incomplete at his death in 1576, to be completed by Palma Giovane.  Titian had intended it to hang over his grave, and the two stages of painting were to make it fit in two different churches.\\nThe picture is among Titian's last, one of several left unfinished at his death.  An inscription in the lower part of the picture records that it was finished by Palma Giovane, whose interventions seem to have been kept to the minimum necessary, and doing his best to match Titian's own style.  A minimalist view of the areas he worked on is that it 'was limited to the angel with the torch and to touching up the tympanum of the stone shrine', but the female statue and Jerome's cloak have also been suspected of showing his hand, and he may have touched up the architecture more generally.The painting is one of a group in Titian's distinctive late style, which begins fully about 1570, though continuing trends seen in earlier works as far back as the mid-1550s.  He often kept paintings in the studio for a long period, with several probably unfinished at his death in 1576. His brushwork becomes bold, but imprecise and impressionistic, and worked over many times, as recorded in a famous description by Palma Giovane.  The distinction between forms and the space between them almost disappears, and 'The forms emerge like wraiths out of the circumambient darkness, and mass is reduced to a flickering pattern of colour and light.  In his last years only these elements had reality for Titian.'There is a long-running argument about which of the works of the 1570s have been completed, and by whom. In this case, the main group of the Pietà, in its first form, is known to have been delivered by Titian as finished, and the full expanded composition to have been finished by Palma Giovane.  Other important paintings of the 1570s are Tarquin and Lucretia, which was delivered in 1571, the Saint Jerome delivered in 1575, and the Flaying of Marsyas, The Death of Actaeon, the Hermitage Museum's Saint Sebastian and the Crowning with Thorns in Munich, all of which were probably in his studio at his death.",

    "abstract": "Pope Paul III and His Grandsons (Italian: Paolo III e i nipoti Alessandro e Ottavio Farnese) is a painting in oil on canvas by Titian, housed in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples. It was commissioned by the Farnese family and painted during Titian's visit to Rome between autumn 1545 and June 1546. It depicts the scabrous relationship between Pope Paul III and his grandsons, Ottavio and Alessandro Farnese. Ottavio is shown in the act of kneeling, to his left; Alessandro, wearing a cardinal's dress, stands behind him to his right. The painting explores the effects of ageing and the manoeuvring behind succession; Paul was at the time in his late seventies and ruling in an uncertain political climate as Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor came into ascendancy.\\nPaul was not a religious man; he viewed the papacy as a means to consolidate his family's position. He appointed Alessandro as cardinal against accusations of nepotism, fathered a number of illegitimate children, and spent large sums of church money collecting art and antiquities. Around 1545 Charles took the political and military advantage, weakening Paul's hold on the papacy. Aware of the changing tides of influence, Titian abandoned the commission before completion, and for the next 100 years the painting languished unframed in a Farnese cellar.\\nPope Paul III and His Grandsons ranks as one of Titian's finest and most penetrating works. Although unfinished and less technically accomplished than his Portrait of Pope Paul III of a few years earlier, it is renowned for its rich colouring; the deep reds of the tablecloth and the almost spectral whites of Paul's gown. The panel contains subtle indications of the contradictions in the character of the Pope, and captures the complex psychological dynamic between the three men.",

Pesaro was a member of the leading patrician Pesaro family, who was appointed by the Borgia Pope Alexander VI a papal legate, commander of the Papal fleet in the region, and bishop of Paphos on Cyprus, a Greek island which was then a Venetian territory.It has sometimes been thought to be Titian's earliest painting, dating to as early as 1503, but this is now not believed, and a date nearer 1510-11 seems more likely.",

The work of a mature artist, it shows the woman with Renaissance ideal proportions and a natural expressive force. The composition is clear.La Bella is often discussed as alternative to Titian's Portrait of Isabella d'Este in Vienna, because the order was a cajoling rejuvenated portrait by the more than 60 years old art patron. Eye colour, hair colour, eye brows and sex appeal would even homogenize all portraits of Isabella d'Este.Titian likely used the same model for the Venus of Urbino. Both pictures are documented in letters by Francesco Maria I della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, who was the husband of Isabella's daughter Eleonora Gonzaga. The Venus of Urbino was painted for the marriage of their son, so there are similarities and the environment of the same family.\\nSymbol language: La Bella points with her hand to a zibellino, which is associated with the Venetian mature noble ladies and again, Isabella d'Este was one of the first ladies to wear.",

Venus, said to have been born from a shell, is identified by the shell at bottom left. It is smaller than usual in the birth of Venus scenes, such as Botticelli's, and is just intended to identify the subject rather than be a boat-like vessel for Venus, as in Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus and other depictions.  \\nThe voluptuousness of the Venus presented, and her sideways glance, also owes much to the Crouching Venus and Cnidian Venus types of antique sculpture.  The wringing of her hair is a direct imitation of Apelles's lost masterwork of the same title.  Titian deliberately included this detail to prove that he could rival the art of antiquity in which the goddess was also washing her hair — a fact mentioned in Pliny's Natural History. \\nThe painting is in exceptionally fine condition.  It was once owned by Christina of Sweden, and passed via the Orleans Collection to 6th Duke of Sutherland, who lent it and 26 other paintings to the National Gallery of Scotland in 1945.  On the death of the childless Duke in 2000, the work was acquired from his cousin, Francis Egerton, 7th Duke of Sutherland for more than £11m in 2003, with the aid of the National Arts Collection Fund.  Also contributing to the purchase were the Wolfson Foundation, the Heritage Lottery Fund (£7.6m), and the Scottish Executive (£2.5m).  To facilitate the sale, £2.4m of the picture's value was offset against inheritance tax.  The market value has been estimated at £20m. After the sale, the 7th Duke said, 'To all intents and purposes nothing has changed, except the painting will now belong to the nation.' \\nIt soon afterwards formed the centrepiece of an exhibition in 2004 and the anniversary exhibition 'Saved!' for the National Art Collections Fund.",

    "abstract": "The Pardo Venus is a painting by the Venetian artist Titian, completed in 1551 and now in the Louvre Museum.  It is also known as Jupiter and Antiope, since it seems to show the story of Jupiter and Antiope from Book VI of the Metamorphoses (lines 110-111). It is Titian's largest mythological painting, and was the first major mythological painting produced by the artist for Philip II of Spain.  It was long kept in the Royal Palace of El Pardo near Madrid (not to be confused with the Prado, a purpose-built museum), hence its usual name; whether Venus is actually represented is uncertain. It later belonged to the English and French royal collections.\\n\\nAnalysis of its style and composition shows that Titian modified a Bacchanalian scene he had begun much earlier in his career by completing the landscape background and adding figures.  For Sidney Freedburg it was 'probably in substance an invention of the later 1530s, though significantly reworked later; it is full of motifs and ideas that have been recollected from an earlier and more Giorgionesque time, ordered in an obvious and uncomplicated classicizing scheme.'Though, if Antiope is the nude, the painting meets the basic definition of Titian's famous poesie series, mythological scenes from Ovid painted for Philip, the painting is typically not counted in the series, either as it was begun well before Titian used the term in a letter to Philip, or because the nude is indeed Venus, in which case no such scene is described by Ovid.\\n\\n",

She is watched by two elderly men, acquaintances of her husband, who desire her. The lustful elders are depicted in the painting hiding behind a rose trellis in her garden. They are watching and spying on her, trying to find an opportunity to catch her alone in the garden.\\nThe story of Susanna and the elders was frequently depicted in art history. The painting is full of symbols. The objects beside the main figure included white pearls, silver jewelry, a silk shawl, and a silver jug. The painting is considered one of Tintoretto's 'masterpieces'.",

An advance payment was given to Raphael, who originally held the commission for the subject of a Triumph of Bacchus. At the time of Raphael's death in 1520, only a preliminary drawing was completed and the commission was then handed to Titian. In the case of Bacchus and Ariadne, the subject matter was derived from the Roman poets Catullus and Ovid.\\nThe painting, considered one of Titian's greatest works, now hangs in the National Gallery in London. The other major paintings in the cycle are The Feast of the Gods (mostly by Giovanni Bellini, now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C), and Titian's The Bacchanal of the Andrians and The Worship of Venus (both now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid).",

    "abstract": "The Venetian Renaissance painter Titian and his workshop produced many versions of Venus and Musician, which may be known by various other titles specifying the elements, such as Venus with an Organist, Venus with a Lute-player, and so on.  Most versions have a man playing a small organ on the left, but in others a lute is being played.  Venus has a small companion on her pillows, sometimes a Cupid and in other versions a dog, or in Berlin both.  The paintings are thought to date from the late 1540s onwards.  \\nMany of Titian's paintings exist in several versions, especially his nude mythological subjects.  Later versions tend to be mostly or entirely by his workshop, with the degree of Titian's personal contribution uncertain and the subject of differing views.  All the versions of the Venus and Musician are in oil on canvas, and fall into two proportions and sizes, with two of the organist versions wider.The five versions generally regarded as at least largely by Titian are, with an organist, the two in Madrid and one in Berlin, and with a lutenist those in Cambridge and New York.  Another version in the Uffizi in Florence is less highly regarded, and has no musician, but a Cupid, as well as a black and white dog at the foot of the bed, eyeing a partridge on the parapet.In all the versions Venus' bed appears to be set in a loggia or against a large open window with a low stone wall or parapet.  Venus is shown at full-length, reclining on pillows.  The musician sits on the end of the bed with his back to her, but is turned round to look towards her.  By contrast she looks away to the right.  He wears contemporary 16th-century dress, as do any small figures in the landscape backgrounds, and has a sword or dagger at his belt.  A large red drape takes up the top left corner, and the top right corner in the less wide versions.  There is a wide landscape outside, falling into two types. The two Prado versions show avenues of trees and a fountain in what seems to be the gardens of a palace.  The other versions have a more open landscape, leading to distant mountains.",

    "abstract": "The Pesaro Madonna (Italian: Pala Pesaro) (better known as the Madonna di Ca' Pesaro) is a painting by the late Italian Renaissance master Titian, commissioned by Jacopo Pesaro, whose family acquired in 1518 the chapel in the Frari Basilica in Venice for which the work was painted, and where it remains today.  Jacopo was Bishop of Paphos, in Cyprus, and had been named commander of the papal fleet by the Borgia pope, Alexander VI. This painting recalls one of Titian's earliest paintings Jacopo Pesaro being presented by Pope Alexander VI to Saint Peter, c. 1510-11",
