The masterpiece is also known as La mestiza en su tocador which translates into English as The Mestiza at Her Dressing Table or Mestiza Lady at Her Dresser. Una Mestiza is also alternately called Charing.  Coincidentally, this alternate title is the nickname of Luna's sister-in-law Rosario Melgar.  Luna donated Una Mestiza to the Biblioteca Museu Victor Balaguer (Victor Balaguer Library Museum) of Vilanova i la Geltrú in the province of Barcelona in Spain.  The Una Mestiza painting won an award at the Exposicion General de las Filipinas (Philippine General Exposition).",

      "Ensueños de Amor, literally 'Daydreams of Love', is a 'dreamy' oil on wood painting by Filipino painter and revolutionary activist Juan Luna.  It depicts Luna's wife Maria de la Paz Pardo de Tavera while sound asleep. It is currently a part of the art collection of the Lopez Museum.Measuring 10½ inches × 12¾ inches, it is a contrapposto beneath the cover of bed sheets.  The predominant color used by Luna for Ensueños de Amor is white with dashes of pink, green, and blue hues.  Luna used rapid brush strokes to express the dreamy mood.The idealism of this painting masks a darker fact in real life, for although Luna was fond of his wife, he was unfortunately also prone to fits of violent jealousy. On September 23, 1892, after accusing her of adultery, he killed his wife and mother-in-law as well as seriously wounding his brother-in-law. Luna was charged with murder but was acquitted shortly thereafter, his deed judged as a crime of passion.",

    abstract:
      "The Parisian Life, also known as Interior d'un Cafi (also spelled Interior d’Un Café, literally meaning 'Inside a Café'), is an 1892 oil on canvas impressionist painting by Filipino painter and revolutionary activist Juan Luna. The painting presently owned by the Government Service Insurance System is currently exhibited at the National Museum of Fine Arts after the state pension fund transferred management of its collection to the National Museum in March 2012.Measuring 57 cm × 79 cm (22 in × 31 in), The Parisian Life is one of the masterpieces that Luna created when he stayed in Paris, France from October 1884 to February 1893.  His own personal “Parisian life” was a total of eight years.  This period in Luna’s career in painting is known as the post-academic or the Parisian period, a time when his style moved away from having “dark colors of the academic palette” and became “increasingly lighter in color and mood”.  As an artist, Luna became renowned on the European continent and became “a familiar of the French and Spanish royal courts”.  During the period, apart from his heightening artistry Luna was also participating in the Philippine propaganda movement together with José Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines.  Months after painting The Parisian Life, Luna would be departing from Paris to Madrid, Spain then to the Manila, Philippines in 1894 in order to rejoin Rizal and Dr. Ariston Bautista Lin, and perform his role in the Philippine Revolution and war of independence in 1896.During this time, Luna also had to deal with the death of an infant daughter and the alleged extra-marital affair of his wife Paz Pardo de Tavera with a French physician.  Because of jealousy, Luna killed his wife and his mother-in-law.  Luna also attempted to kill his brother-in-law.  A French court charged Luna for committing a 'crime of passion' but was acquitted of parricide and murder on February 7, 1893.\\nThe Parisian Life is regarded as the last major work Luna did during his post-academic and life in Paris because from 1894 Luna travelled frequently that he was only able to paint a few number of landscapes in the Philippines.  When Luna returned to France in 1898, he was an appointed member of the delegation in Paris representing the Philippine revolutionary government tasked to work for the diplomatic recognition of the Philippines as an independent Republic.  In 1899, Luna died in Hong Kong while on the way back to the Philippines.",

In 1886, it was sold to the Diputación Provincial de Barcelona for 20,000 pesetas. It currently hangs in the main gallery at the first floor of the National Museum of Fine Arts in Manila, and is the first work of art that greets visitors upon entry into the museum. The picture recreates a despoiling scene in a Roman circus where dead gladiators are stripped of weapons and garments.\\nLuna, working on canvas, spent eight months completing the painting which depicts dying gladiators. Filipino historian Ambeth Ocampo writes, '...the fact remains that when Luna and Félix Resurrección Hidalgo won the top awards in the Madrid Exposition of 1884, they proved to the world that indios could, despite their supposed barbarian race, paint better than the Spaniards who colonized them.'",

She is looking to her left with a melancholy expression.  The cathedral of Notre Dame can be seen in the background, as well as a bridge which appears to be the Pont Royal.

It is now in the Museo Soumaya in Mexico City.It shows Elizabeth Kerr (née Fortescue), daughter of Chichester Fortescue (1718–1757), High Sheriff of County Down in what is now Northern Ireland. Reynolds also painted her at least twice between her marriage in 1762 and her husband's succession to the marquisate in 1775 – these half-lengths are on show at Blickling Hall and Fyvie Castle. John Spilsbury engraved the c.1769 work in 1770, though he altered a few details of the dress.The c. 1769 work was inherited by William and Elizabeth's seventh child and second son Lord Charles Beauchamp Kerr (1775–1816), who passed it to his own son Captain Beauchamp Kerr. Sometime before 1899 it came into the hands of one E. Beckett, who sold it to Agnew's that year. Agnew's sold it on four days later to George J. Gould, who bequeathed it to a private collector in Washington, D.C. That private collector then sold it at auction at Sotheby's New York on 9 June 2011, where it was bought by its present owner for $62,500 (then equivalent to £38,514).",

Purchased for 35,000 francs by the American art collector and speculator John Wolfe on 26 June, 1873, it was displayed in his mansion for many years alongside other high-style French academic paintings.  It was sold at auction in 1888, after which the painting was displayed in the bar of the Hoffman House Hotel, New York City until 1901, when it was bought and stored in a warehouse, the buyer hoping to keep its 'offensive' content from the public. Robert Sterling Clark discovered the piece in storage and acquired it in 1942. The piece is currently on display at the Clark Art Institute located in Williamstown, Massachusetts.\\nAccording to the Clark Institute, in the painting 'a group of nymphs have been surprised, while bathing in a secluded pond, by a lascivious satyr. Some of the nymphs have retreated into the shadows on the right; others, braver than their friends, are trying to dampen the satyr's ardor by pulling him into the cold water -- one of the satyr's hooves is already wet and he clearly wants to go no further.  Bouguereau’s working methods were traditional; he made a number of sketches and drawings of carefully posed human figures in complicated interconnected poses, linking them together in this wonderfully rhythmical composition.'In the exhibition of 1873 it was displayed along with a verse from the ancient Roman poet, Publius Statius: “Conscious of his shaggy hide and from childhood untaught to swim, he dares not trust himself to deep waters.”The painting, the largest and one of the most beloved of the Clark collection, was cleaned prior to March 10, 2012 with the help of a grant from the Parnassus Foundation, courtesy of Jane and Raphael Bernstein.",

In the background is the city of Jerusalem under a cloudy sky.\\nThe painting marked Gérôme's return to history painting after a period of exploring orientalism. Like much Christian art of the era, the depiction was influenced by Ernest Renan's Life of Jesus.The painting was presented at the 1868 Salon. Since 1990 it is located at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris.",

      "The Shepherdess (French: Pastourelle), also known as The Little Shepherdess, is a painting by William-Adolphe Bouguereau completed in 1889. The title is taken from the Southern French dialect. The painting depicts an idyllic, pastoral scene of a lone young woman in peasant attire posed for the artist, balancing a stick (likely her crook) across her shoulders, standing barefooted in the foreground. In the background are oxen grazing in a field. It is one of many paintings by Bouguereau depicting shepherdesses, including one of the same name created in 1881. The subject is a model employed by Bouguereau for this and other paintings, including The Bohemian.\\nThe Shepherdess is currently in the permanent collection at the Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa, where it has become an emblematic image for the museum.  It was the central image of a travelling exhibition about Bouguereau and his students that Philbrook created in 2006.",

    abstract:
      "The Elder Sister (French: La soeur aînée) is a painting by nineteenth-century French academic artist, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, in 1869. The painting was acquired in 1992 by the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, as a gift. According to the museum website, the painting was the gift of an anonymous lady in memory of her father. Since then, The Elder Sister has been a part of the permanent collection of the museum and is placed in its 'Arts of Europe' section. It has become one of the most notable highlights among the museum's collection of paintings.The painting shows a girl ('the elder sister') sitting on a rock and holding a sleeping baby on her lap. A quiet rural landscape serves as the background. For this scene, Bouguereau's daughter, Henriette, and son, Paul, served as models. Bouguereau used great care and attention in drawing the children's features and the positioning of their bodies, giving them an idyllic look. The girl's eyes look directly at the viewer and both children are shown with immaculate clothing.The dimensions of the painting are 51¼ × 38¼ in (130.2 × 97.2 cm) and the frame is 67½ × 55 × 5½ in (171.5 × 139.7 × 14 cm).Another painting by Bouguereau also is entitled, The Elder Sister (completed in 1864). It currently belongs to the permanent collection of the Brooklyn Museum.",

    abstract:
      "The Birth of Venus  (French: Naissance de Venus) is a painting by the French artist Alexandre Cabanel. It was painted in 1863, and is now in the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. A second and smaller version (85 x 135.9 cm) from ca. 1864 is in Dahesh Museum of Art. A third (106 x 182.6 cm) version dates from 1875; it is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.\\nShown to great success at the Paris Salon of 1863, The Birth of Venus was immediately purchased by Napoleon III for his own personal collection.\\nThat same year Cabanel was made a professor of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.\\nCabanel's erotic imagery, cloaked in historicism, appealed to the propriety of the higher levels of society. Art historian and curator Robert Rosenblum wrote of Cabanel's The Birth of Venus that 'This Venus hovers somewhere between an ancient deity and a modern dream'; he described 'the ambiguity of her eyes, that seem to be closed but that a close look reveals that she is awake ...  A nude who could be asleep or awake is specially formidable for a male viewer'.Cabanel was a determined opponent of the Impressionists, especially Édouard Manet, although the refusal of the academic establishment to realize the importance of new ideas and sources of inspiration would eventually prove to be the undoing of the Academy.\\nAt the Salon of 1863, The Birth of Venus was one of a multitude of female nudes. Bathed in opalescent colors, the goddess Venus shyly looks to the viewer from beneath the crook of her elbow. Two years later, Manet presented his now renowned painting Olympia at the Salon as well. Today both hang in the Musee’d’ Orsay. Unlike Venus's ethereal-like palette, Manet painted Olympia with pale, placid skin tone, and darkly outlined the figure. Her only seemingly modest gesture is her placement of her hand over her leg, though it is not out of shyness- one must pay before they can see. James Rubin writes of the two works: “The Olympia is often compared to Cabanel’s Birth of Venus, for the latter is a far more sexually appealing work, despite its mythological guise… It is evident Manet’s demythologizing of the female nude was foremost a timely reminder of modern realities. The majority of critics attacked the painting with unmitigated disgust…: “What is this odalisque with the yellow belly, ignoble model dredged up from who knows where?” [And] “The painter’s attitude is of inconceivable vulgarity.”Cabanel depicts personality, but in subtle ways through her relaxed posture and sleepy expression. Jenna-Marie Newberry writes of Venus: “The lightest of color used in The Birth of Venus alludes to the lightness and enlightenment of relaxation, amplifying the reclining nude’s placid demeanor and virginity. The contrapposto twist of the figure with the melodramatic swoop of the arm over the face comes directly from his previous paintings … Venus herself takes over the entire front of the picture plane. Her hair has been deepened, adding more to her allure and purity.” It is as if the viewer is catching a glimpse of a goddess simply basking in the nature that enfolds her. She is calm, and asks nothing with her gaze. She is a part of her surroundings and the viewer is privy to behold upon the scene. By adhering to the accepted canon of the day, Cabanel produced a quite seductive painting of a mythological beauty presented in a calculated way that was acceptable for viewers at the time of its creation. Following the Salon it was said: “His dark-eyed heroines, thinly painted, usually in muted colors and immaculately drawn, were popular on both sides of the Atlantic”.Over time, Alexandre developed what would become his signature style. It was his attention to detail that made him popular in the nineteenth century. Cabanel was schooled at the Ecole des Beaux Arts under the painter François-Edouard Picot. Following his tutelage, he entered his first Salon in 1843 and won second place in the Prix de Rome in 1845. “Several major decorative commissions followed including the ceiling in the Cabinet des Dessins in the Louvre, and are typical of Cabanel’s talent for achieving sumptuous effects.” Initially famous for his mythological paintings, Cabanel also made a name for himself in Europe and abroad through his portraits.  “Praised as a portraitist of women, Cabanel expressed that he was particularly adept at painting portraits of American women.”A portrait by Cabanel was a desirable commodity. He was a favored portraitist of the Emperor Napoleon himself, and he also refused to travel outside France to accept a commission. This required American elite to travel to Paris to sit for him. “Cabanel had the ability to lend his sitters an air of gentility and urbanity, and to give them an aristocratic allure … '  C.H Stranahan summarized the appeal of Cabanel's style shortly before his death saying: “…He is especially the master of every grace attractive to woman; great judiciousness in rendering what his subtle reading of the human face gives him; great power and knowledge of hands, which leads to his throwing a veil of mystery over the expression, even leaving a softening vagueness…' \\nUpon his death in 1889, “Journals and dailies paid indulgent tribute to Cabanel in obituaries.” In one, he was called “the most distinguished painter of the grand style,” and “all commented on Cabanel’s liberal teaching'.\\n\\n",

The painting features Greek mythological figures Cupid and Psyché, sharing an embrace and kiss. Bouguereau was a Classical-style painter in the Neoclassical era of art. The painting is characterized by the frothy background the figures delicately stand on. It depicts the beginning of the forbidden romance of Cupid and Psyche, a popular subject at the time of execution.",

      "The Slave Market is a painting of about 1882 by the 19th century French artist Gustave Boulanger, who specialized in classical and Orientalist genre scenes. It depicts an Ancient Roman slave auction. It shows the marketing of seven young people, ranging in age from children to young adults, as slaves. The three male slaves, as well as two of the female slaves, bear a similarity in appearance perhaps suggesting that they are members of a family forced into slavery by economic conditions. All are wearing tags to indicate their availability as slaves. The youngest boy is completely naked, while the young man next to him is wearing a loincloth. The adolescent sitting next to them is holding his knees close to his chest in a protective pose. The standing African woman is also topless, wearing a white loincloth, and she is covering her breasts with her hands. The taller, standing, young woman is wearing a translucent garment which clearly shows her breasts and pubic hair—she is trying to shield her eyes, perhaps because her potential buyers include former friends and neighbors, who are probably seeing her nude for the first time. The adolescent girl next to her is also topless and barefoot, wearing a skirt. The young woman crouching next to them is wearing a loose garment which leaves buttocks exposed. Between the male and female slaves, the auctioneer sits eating his lunch with a very casual attitude.\\nFrom a common type of Salon academic art of the period, it depicts an eroticized scene clad as a history painting, as was customary at the time in Paris. Boulanger had visited Italy, Greece, and North Africa, and the painting reflects his attention to culturally correct details and skill in rendering the female form.",

      "The Pearl and the Wave (French: La Perle et la vague), also known as The Wave and the Pearl, is a painting by the French artist Paul-Jacques-Aimé Baudry created in 1862.  The painting shows a nude woman lying on the edge of a rocky sea shore, with her head turned to gaze backward over her shoulder towards the viewer. Waves are breaking in the background.\\nThe Pearl and the Wave was the subject of contemporary curiosity. The painting was met with praise from art critics for its technique and distinguishing quality. Artist Kenyon Cox described The Pearl and the Wave as 'the most perfect painting of the nude' in the 19th century. Cox identified some features in the painting which he described as 'grace of attitude', the well-rounded but slim body of a young woman, the visible dimple in the shoulder, the 'savoring of subtle line', the 'loveliness of the color', the 'solid yet mysterious modelling', and the 'perfection of delicate surface'. Cox believed these features make this painting what he calls 'a pure masterpiece'.Art historian Bailey Van Hook identified The Pearl and the Wave as one of the examples of nude paintings where the subject woman is shown lying down sluggishly for the gratification of the looker-on who she describes as 'voyeuristic viewer'. Nineteenth-century French art critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary commented that the woman in the painting may be 'a Parisian modiste ... lying in wait for a millionaire gone astray in this wild spot.'In 1863, Empress consort Eugénie de Montijo bought the painting for 20,000 francs. It was her second most costly purchase of the paintings of that time. Today the painting is in the collection of the Museo del Prado in Madrid, the main Spanish national art museum.\\n\\n",

Her right arm is resting on her thigh while the palm of her left hand is pressed down on her left knee so that she does not lean on the violin. Her hands are clasped with the fingers pointing forward while her shoulders are wrapped in a shawl dyed maroon and light green, and she is wearing a gray dress that extends to her ankles. The bow of the violin has been stuck through diagonally under the fingerboard. To her right is a maple tree.\\nThe subject is a model employed by Bouguereau for this and other paintings, including The Shepherdess.\\nIt was owned by the Minneapolis Institute of Art until 2004 when it was auctioned by Christie's to benefit the acquisition fund.",

It is currently in the collection of the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska, and was acquired in 1951 as the gift of Francis T. B. Martin.  The painting was brought to Omaha shortly after it was completed by George W. Lininger.  Lininger was an art collector and private gallery owner who routinely opened his gallery to the public for no charge.The painting was physically attacked twice - in 1890 and in 1976. Both times, damages were minimal. The attackers were offended by the painting's overtly sensual nudity.\\nA replica of the painting appeared in the ballroom scene at the Beaufort home in the 1993 film, The Age of Innocence (though the film takes place in the 1870s, years before the painting was created).",

    abstract:
      "The Birth of Venus (French: La Naissance de Vénus) is one of the most famous paintings by 19th-century painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau. It depicts not the actual birth of Venus from the sea, but her transportation in a shell as a fully mature woman from the sea to Paphos in Cyprus. She is considered the epitome of the Classical Greek and Roman ideal of the female form and beauty, on par with Venus de Milo. \\nFor Bouguereau, it is considered a tour de force. The canvas stands at just over 9 ft 10 in (3.00 m) high, and 7 ft 2 in (2.18 m) wide. The subject matter, as well as the composition, resembles a previous rendition of this subject, Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus, as well as Raphael's The Triumph of Galatea.",
