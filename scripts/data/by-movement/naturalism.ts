      "The Ray (French: La raie) is a still life painting by Jean Simeon Chardin, first exhibited at the Exposition de la Jeunesse on 3 June 1728, and long held by the Louvre in Paris. \\nThe painting was first shown at the Exposition de la Jeunesse on 3 June 1728, a free open air exhibition held for a few hours at the corner of the Place Dauphine and the Pont Neuf each year on the day of Corpus Christi (but postponed in the event of rain to Sunday after the end of the octave, Little Corpus Christi or Petite Fête-Dieu).\\nChardin depicts the bloody underside of a flattened fish, a skate, gutted and hanging from a hook on the stone wall, above a shelf on which are various domestic items to the right two metal pans, a ceramic jug and a bottle, and a knife, all on a white cloth; below the skate are two other fish, and further to the left some opened oysters and a cat with arched back and fur raised, as if frightened by the sight.  The composition can be analysed as a series of pyramids, with the pointed skate in the centre, the jug and other inanimate objects to the right, and the cat and oysters to the left.  The handle of the knife hanging off the ledge, and the return corner of the stone wall leading past the cat away from the viewer, add depth to the scene.  The painting measures 114 cm × 146 cm (45 in × 57 in).\\nChardin was influenced by the Dutch still life paintings of the 17th century: the scene has been compared to Rembrandt's painting of the Slaughtered Ox.  Although described by Diderot as ''disgusting', the peculiar but realistic composition was admired by other artists, including Matisse.  Marcel Proust likened the image of the eponymous ray to the 'nave of a polychromatic cathedral.'On 25 September 1728, Simeon Chardin exhibited the painting and The Buffet as his reception pieces to the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture.   Both works remained with the Academy until the French Revolution, when they were moved to the new Muséum Central des Arts, now the Louvre.",

On the desk is a 'lampe à quinquet', invented by Leroy himself. Together the lamp and book make reference to Cesare Ripa's Iconologia, which states these are the attributes of a study.\\nThe naturalistic attention to detail and its bright tonality show how David was influenced by Flemish painters during his 1781 stay in Flanders. One of his pupils, Jean-François Garneray, assisted in painting the hands and fabrics. It was first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1783.",

      "The Death of Marat (French: La Mort de Marat or Marat Assassiné) is a 1793 painting by Jacques-Louis David of the murdered French revolutionary leader Jean-Paul Marat. It is one of the most famous images of the French Revolution. David was the leading French painter, as well as a Montagnard and a member of the revolutionary Committee of General Security. The painting shows the radical journalist lying dead in his bath on July 13, 1793, after his murder by Charlotte Corday. Painted in the months after Marat's murder, it has been described by T. J. Clark as the first modernist painting, for 'the way it took the stuff of politics as its material, and did not transmute it'.",
