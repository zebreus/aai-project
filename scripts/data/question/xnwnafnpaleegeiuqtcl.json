  "description": "Franz Marc's Red and Blue Horses is a painting that uses color and geometric shapes to create an abstract representation of two horses in motion. The painting is a masterpiece of Expressionism, a style of art that emphasizes emotions and subjective experience. Marc's use of color and shape creates a dynamic and energetic composition that captures the movement and power of the horses."
