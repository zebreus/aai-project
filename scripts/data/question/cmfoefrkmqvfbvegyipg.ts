  description:
    "A beautiful woman wearing a white topless shirt looks at the viewer with her deep blue eyes. She has chestnut hair, long and curled. Her left hand is resting on her hip while her right hand is holding up a straw hat with a small feather. The background is dark green and the painting is done in a realistic style. The painting shows great skill and attention to detail. The colors are vibrant and the composition is pleasing to the eye.",
