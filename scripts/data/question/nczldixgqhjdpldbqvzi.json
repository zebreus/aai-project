  "description": "An oil painting by Ramon Casas i Carb√≥ depicting two men seated in an open-topped automobile. One of the men is smoking a pipe and wearing a hat, while the other is smoking a cigar and wearing a flat cap. A small white dog is sitting on the back of the car. The landscape is painted in a style reminiscent of American Impressionism, with muted colors and soft brushstrokes."
