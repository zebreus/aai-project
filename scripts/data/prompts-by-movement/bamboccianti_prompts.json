    "description": "A serene landscape featuring a tranquil pond surrounded by lush greenery, with a few large rocks and a small wooden boat partially submerged in the water. A variety of colorful fish swim lazily just beneath the surface, while several crayfish or lobsters scuttle about on the rocks and in the shallow waters. The atmosphere is peaceful, with soft ripples disturbing the otherwise still pond."
