    "description": "A woman stands behind a bar, looking straight ahead with a somewhat distant expression. Her gaze is directed at something just off-screen, but her eyes appear unfocused and slightly glassy. A customer sits at the bar, turned away from the viewer, with his head tilted back and his face obscured by a hat or veil. The atmosphere is dimly lit, with warm tones suggesting a late-night or early-morning setting. The background is a blurred haze of colors, featuring a row of mirrors reflecting the scene in distorted fashion."
