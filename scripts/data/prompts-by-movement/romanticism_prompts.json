    "description": "A serene landscape at dusk, with two figures standing at the edge of a forest, gazing up at a full moon hanging low in the sky. The moon's soft light casts an eerie glow on the couple's faces, their expressions contemplative and introspective. They are surrounded by dense foliage, with tall trees looming behind them like sentinels. In the foreground, a worn stone path stretches out into the darkness, disappearing from view."
