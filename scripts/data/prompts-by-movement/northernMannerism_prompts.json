    "description": "A mystical scene depicting the passing of time, featuring an ornate clock surrounded by swirling clouds and wispy tendrils. The clock's face glows softly in the darkness, as a winged figure bearing the visage of Time herself (or himself) reaches out to grasp a flowing banner inscribed with the words \"Vita brevis\" (\"Life is short\"). In the background, a celestial landscape unfolds, with stars and constellations twinkling against a deep blue sky. The overall atmosphere is one of contemplative melancholy, inviting the viewer to ponder the fleeting nature of mortal existence."
