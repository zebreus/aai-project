    "description": "A late 19th-century oil on canvas depiction of a medical consultation, featuring a middle-aged doctor sitting behind a wooden desk, surrounded by various medical instruments and texts. The doctor is engaged in conversation with a seated patient, a young woman with a serious expression. The scene is set against a warm, natural background with hints of wood paneling. Soft light illuminates the space, casting gentle shadows on the figures and objects."
