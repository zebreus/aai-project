    "paintingLabel": "Bust of Louis XIV of France by Jean Varin (National Museum in Warsaw)",
    "artistName": "Jean Varin",
    "description": "A grandiose portrait of a majestic monarch, depicted in a three-quarter view, with a stern yet regal expression. He wears a lavish golden crown adorned with precious gems, resting atop his powdered wig and framing his dignified face. His eyes gaze forthwith, exuding authority and confidence. A white periwig drapes elegantly across his shoulders, while a soft, white collar and lace-edged cuffs add to the overall sense of opulence. The subject's face is rendered in delicate, nuanced strokes, with subtle shading and texture adding depth and dimensionality. In the background, subtle architectural details provide context without distracting from the monarch's imposing presence."
