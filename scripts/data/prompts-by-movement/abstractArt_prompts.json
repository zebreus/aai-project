    "description": "A woman stands at the edge of a small clearing, her dark hair whipping about in the gusts as a thunderstorm approaches. She wears a bright yellow dress that seems to glow against the impending darkness, and her arms are raised in a futile attempt to shield herself from the tempest. In the background, towering trees sway ominously, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching towards the turbulent sky."

The riders' clothing is adorned with intricate patterns and colors, echoing the vibrant tones of the horses."

    "artistName": "Jørleif Uthaug",
    "description": "A serene coastal scene featuring a majestic sea goddess, Amphitrite, standing at the edge of a rocky outcropping, surrounded by undulating waves and foamy crests. She wears a flowing white gown with seaweed-like tendrils draped across her shoulders, as seagulls and other seabirds soar overhead, their silhouettes stark against the cerulean sky. The rocky shore is scattered with weathered driftwood and shells, while in the distance, the sea stretches out to meet the horizon, where a subtle misty veil rises to meet the sun's gentle rays."
