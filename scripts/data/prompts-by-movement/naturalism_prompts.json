    "description": "A serene rural scene featuring a group of women dressed in traditional clothing, plucking geese at the water's edge on a misty morning. The atmosphere is tranquil, with soft golden light casting long shadows across the wet grass and wooden fence posts. The women's faces are turned away from the viewer, their expressions contemplative as they focus on their task. The geese lie limp and still, their feathers ruffled by the gentle breeze. In the background, a distant farmhouse rises above the rolling hills, its chimney puffing out wisps of smoke into the misty air."
