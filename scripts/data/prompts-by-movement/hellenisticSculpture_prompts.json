    "description": "A classical marble sculpture depicting a mythological goddess, standing nude and relaxed, her body rendered in smooth, flowing curves. The subject's face is serene, with a subtle smile playing on her lips. Her arms are outstretched to either side, holding a broken pillar or column, symbolizing her vulnerability and tragedy. The surrounding environment is minimalist, with no discernible background or context, allowing the viewer's focus to remain solely on the goddess's figure."

    "description": "A majestic quadruped stands proudly, its muscular body rendered in exquisite detail, with intricate veins visible beneath its gleaming coat. The animal's head is held high, eyes gazing upwards as if in reverence. A delicate filigree adorns its mane, while a subtle sheen on the coat suggests a warm, sunlit setting. In the background, a series of ornate arches and columns stretch towards the sky, their intricate carvings and moldings adding depth and texture to the scene."
