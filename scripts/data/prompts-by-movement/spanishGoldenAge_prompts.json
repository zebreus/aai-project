    "artistName": "El Greco",
    "description": "A dimly lit chapel interior, with a sense of reverence and solemnity, features a majestic figure lying in state on an ornate catafalque, surrounded by somber-faced mourners clad in dark attire. The figure's face is serene, while the mourners' faces convey a mix of sorrow and awe. Above, a vaulted ceiling rises to a point, with a faint glow emanating from it, casting long shadows across the scene. The air is thick with candles and incense, adding to the sense of mystery and spirituality."
