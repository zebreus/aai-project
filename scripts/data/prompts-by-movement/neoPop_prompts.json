    "description": "A dynamic comic book-inspired scene depicting a high-speed dogfight between two fighter jets, set against a bright blue sky filled with puffy white clouds. The aircraft are rendered in bold black outlines and flat primary colors, with sharp points and geometric shapes emphasizing their speed and momentum. One jet is mid-blast-off, its engines blazing with bright red flames, while the other is swooping in for a head-on collision, leaving a trail of condensed air behind it. In the foreground, a burst of yellow smoke or debris erupts from the impact zone, adding to the sense of urgency and chaos."
