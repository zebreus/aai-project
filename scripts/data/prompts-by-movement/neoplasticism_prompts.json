    "artistName": "Piet Mondrian",
    "description": "A geometric abstraction featuring vertical and horizontal black lines intersecting to divide the canvas into rectangular sections, with bold strokes of primary colors (red, blue, and yellow) applied within these compartments in distinct shapes and patterns, including chevrons, triangles, and squares. The overall composition is characterized by a sense of balance, harmony, and dynamism, as if the geometric forms are in motion or vibration, against a neutral or subtly textured background."
