    "description": "A young male figure stands upright, his torso rendered in elegant curves, with defined pectoral muscles and a subtle definition at the waistline. His left arm is relaxed by his side, while his right hand rests on the hilt of a sword sheathed at his hip. His face is youthful, with high cheekbones, a small nose, and lips that curve into a gentle smile. The figure's eyes are cast downward, as if lost in thought. A classical Greek column or pilaster provides a subtle background, with intricate carvings that add texture to the overall composition. The palette is characterized by warm tones of flesh, with accents of blue and green."
