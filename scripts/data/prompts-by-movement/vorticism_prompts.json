    "description": "Vibrant, expressive painting featuring abstracted forms in shades of blue, green, and yellow, set against a warm beige background. The composition is characterized by sweeping brushstrokes and textured layers, with bold geometric shapes and organic curves blending together to evoke a sense of dynamic movement. A central axis of cool colors (blues and greens) is offset by bursts of warmer hues (yellows and oranges), creating a striking visual tension."
