    "description": "A serene and majestic female figure, depicted in profile, sits on a rocky outcropping surrounded by lush foliage, her gaze cast downward towards a mythical sea serpent entwined around her arm. Her skin is smooth and luminous, with delicate folds and creases framing her face. A golden diadem adorns her brow, studded with gemstones that catch the soft light of a warm and inviting atmosphere. The surrounding landscape features a subtle gradient of blues and greens, evoking a sense of depth and dimensionality, while the subject's flowing robes seem to billow outward, as if gently swept by an unseen breeze."
