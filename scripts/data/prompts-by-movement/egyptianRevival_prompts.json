    "description": "A serene, golden-hued figure sits cross-legged on a raised platform, their hands poised over the strings of an ancient harp. The musician's face is peaceful, eyes cast downward in contemplation, as they gently pluck the instrument. Soft folds of white linen cascade down their back and arms, like wisps of cloud. A delicate, filigree-patterned collar adorns their neck, with intricate details that shimmer in the subtle light. The background is a warm, sandy beige, with faint suggestions of pillars or archways, hinting at a grand structure or temple."
